  author   = "Daily, Jeff",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Sequence alignment algorithms are a key component of
              many bioinformatics applications. Though various fast
              Smith-Waterman local sequence alignment implementations have been
              developed for x86 CPUs, most are embedded into larger database
              search tools. In addition, fast implementations of
              Needleman-Wunsch global sequence alignment and its semi-global
              variants are not as widespread. This article presents the first
              software library for local, global, and semi-global pairwise
              intra-sequence alignments and improves the performance of
              previous intra-sequence implementations. RESULTS: A faster
              intra-sequence local pairwise alignment implementation is
              described and benchmarked, including new global and semi-global
              variants. Using a 375 residue query sequence a speed of 136
              billion cell updates per second (GCUPS) was achieved on a dual
              Intel Xeon E5-2670 24-core processor system, the highest reported
              for an implementation based on Farrar's 'striped' approach.
              Rognes's SWIPE optimal database search application is still
              generally the fastest available at 1.2 to at best 2.4 times
              faster than Parasail for sequences shorter than 500 amino acids.
              However, Parasail was faster for longer sequences. For global
              alignments, Parasail's prefix scan implementation is generally
              the fastest, faster even than Farrar's 'striped' approach,
              however the opal library is faster for single-threaded
              applications. The software library is designed for 64 bit Linux,
              OS X, or Windows on processors with SSE2, SSE41, or AVX2. Source
              code is available from https://github.com/jeffdaily/parasail
              under the Battelle BSD-style license. CONCLUSIONS: Applications
              that require optimal alignment scores could benefit from the
              improved performance. For the first time, SIMD global,
              semi-global, and local alignments are available in a stand-alone

              common sequence analysis step. We introduce a novel approximate
              dynamic programming method that uses conserved immunoglobulin
              gene motifs to improve performance of aligning V-segments of
              rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. Our new algorithm enhances
              the former JOINSOLVER algorithm by processing sequences with
              insertions and/or deletions (indels) and improves the efficiency
              for large datasets provided by high throughput sequencing.
              RESULTS: In our simulations, which include rearrangements with
              indels, the V-matching success rate improved from 61\% for
              partial alignments of sequences with indels in the original
              algorithm to over 99\% in the approximate algorithm. An
              improvement in the alignment of human VDJ rearrangements over the

              processes that underlie B-cell affinity maturation and adaptive
              immunity. The ability to estimate positive and negative selection
              from these sequence data has broad applications not only for
              understanding the immune response to pathogens, but is also
              critical to determining the role of somatic hypermutation in
              autoimmunity and B-cell cancers. Here, we develop a statistical
              framework for Bayesian estimation of Antigen-driven SELectIoN
              (BASELINe) based on the analysis of somatic mutation patterns.
              Our approach represents a fundamental advance over previous
              methods by shifting the problem from one of simply detecting
              selection to one of quantifying selection. Along with providing a
              more intuitive means to assess and visualize selection, our
              approach allows, for the first time, comparative analysis between
              groups of sequences derived from different germline V(D)J
              segments. Application of this approach to next-generation
              sequencing data demonstrates different selection pressures for
              memory cells of different isotypes. This framework can easily be
              adapted to analyze other types of DNA mutation patterns resulting
              from a mutator that displays hot/cold-spots, substitution

              associated with efficient control of viral infections and other

              impossible. The diversity is high and the frequency distribution
              of individual TCRs is heavily skewed; the diversity therefore

              essentially important in monitoring transplantation processes and
              the regulation of immune suppressiva. In this context, algorithms
              and tools are necessary for analyzing the IG and TR diversity on
              nucleotide as well as on amino acid sequence level, identifying
              highly proliferated clonotypes, determining the diversity of the
              cell repertoire found in a sample, comparing different states of
              the human immune system, and visualizing all relevant

              for the detailed characterization and visualization of the state
              of human IG and TR repertoires. IMEX offers a broad range of
              algorithms for statistical analysis of IG and TR data, CDR and
              V-(D)-J analysis, diversity analysis by calculating the
              distribution of IG and TR, calculating primer efficiency, and
              comparing multiple data sets. We use a mathematical model that is
              able to describe the number of unique clonotypes in a sample
              taking into account the true number of unique sequences and read
              errors; we heuristically optimize the parameters of this model.
              IMEX uses IMGT/HighV-QUEST analysis outputs and includes methods
              for splitting and merging to enable the submission to this portal
              and to combine the outputs results, respectively. All calculation

              interfaces to other programs such as DNAML and BEAST. SONAR can
              be downloaded as a ready-to-run Docker image or manually
              installed on a local machine. In the latter case, it can also be

              for broadly-neutralizing antibodies against HIV and influenza. A
              fundamental step in such sequence analysis is to annotate each
              base as coming from a specific one of the V, D, or J genes, or
              from an N-addition (a.k.a. non-templated insertion). Previous

              transitions from state to state in a hidden Markov model (HMM) of
              VDJ recombination, and assumed that mutations occur via the same

              from IMGT; in either case repertoire summaries for the B-cell
              populations tested are available. IGGalaxy supports multi-sample
              and multi-replicate input analysis for both igBLAST and
              IMGT/HIGHV-QUEST. We demonstrate the technical validity of this
              platform using a standard dataset, S22, used for benchmarking the
              performance of antibody alignment utilities with a 99.9 \%
              concordance with previous results. Re-analysis of NGS data from
              our samples of RAG-deficient patients demonstrated the validity
              and user friendliness of this tool. CONCLUSIONS: IGGalaxy
              provides clinical researchers with detailed insight into the
              repertoire of the B-cell population per individual sequenced and
              between control and pathogenic genomes. IGGalaxy was developed
              for 454 NGS results but is capable of analyzing alternative NGS
              data (e.g. Illumina, Ion Torrent). We demonstrate the use of a
              Galaxy virtual machine to determine the VDJ repertoire for
              reference data and from B-cells taken from immune deficient
              patients. IGGalaxy is available as a VM for download and use on a

              Therefore, integrative tools for repertoire reconstruction and
              analysis from antibody sequences are needed. We developed
              ImmunediveRity, a stand-alone pipeline primarily based in R
              programming for the integral analysis of B cell repertoire data
              generated by HTS. The pipeline integrates GNU software and in
              house scripts to perform quality filtering, sequencing noise
              correction and repertoire reconstruction based on V, D and J
              segment assignment, clonal origin and unique heavy chain

              repertoire metrics that in conjunction with a rich graphical
              output facilitates sample comparison and repertoire mining. Its
              performance was tested with raw and curated human and mouse
              454-Roche sequencing benchmarks providing good approximations of
              repertoire structure. Furthermore, ImmunediveRsity was used to
              mine the B cell repertoire of immunized mice with a model
              antigen, allowing the identification of previously validated
              antigen-specific antibodies, and revealing different and
              unexpected clonal diversity patterns in the post-immunization IgM
              and IgG compartments. Although ImmunediveRsity is similar to

              which consists of many rare sequences. Distinguishing between
              true but rare TCR sequences and variants generated by polymerase
              chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing errors remains a formidable
              challenge. The conventional approach to handle errors is to
              remove low quality reads, and/or rare TCR sequences. Such
              filtering discards a large number of true and often rare TCR
              sequences. However, accurate identification and quantification of
              rare TCR sequences is essential for repertoire diversity
              estimation. RESULTS: We devised a pipeline, called Recover TCR
              (RTCR), that accurately recovers TCR sequences, including rare
              TCR sequences, from HTS data (including barcoded data) even at
              low coverage. RTCR employs a data-driven statistical model to
              rectify PCR and sequencing errors in an adaptive manner. Using
              simulations, we demonstrate that RTCR can easily adapt to the
              error profiles of different types of sequencers and exhibits
              consistently high recall and high precision even at low coverages

  abstract = "SUMMARY: High-throughput sequencing provides an opportunity to
              analyse the repertoire of antigen-specific receptors with an
              unprecedented breadth and depth. However, the quantity of raw
              data produced by this technology requires efficient ways to
              categorize and store the output for subsequent analysis. To this
              end, we have defined a simple five-item identifier that uniquely
              and unambiguously defines each TcR sequence. We then describe a
              novel application of finite-state automaton to map Illumina
              short-read sequence data for individual TcRs to their respective
              identifier. An extension of the standard algorithm is also
              described, which allows for the presence of single-base pair
              mismatches arising from sequencing error. The software package,
              named Decombinator, is tested first on a set of artificial in
              silico sequences and then on a set of published human TcR-$\beta$
              sequences. Decombinator assigned sequences at a rate more than
              two orders of magnitude faster than that achieved by classical
              pairwise alignment algorithms, and with a high degree of accuracy
              (>88\%), even after introducing up to 1\% error rates in the in
              silico sequences. Analysis of the published sequence dataset
              highlighted the strong V and J usage bias observed in the human
              peripheral blood repertoire, which seems to be unconnected to
              antigen exposure. The analysis also highlighted the enormous size
              of the available repertoire and the challenge of obtaining a

              We present IMSEQ, a method to derive clonotype repertoires from

              of algorithms for 1) data filtering, 2) calculation of clonotype
              diversity and expression, 3) calculation of gene usage for the V
              and J subgroups, 4) detection of shared and exclusive clonotypes
              among multiple repertoires, and 5) comparison of gene usage for V
              and J subgroups among multiple repertoires. IRProfiler has been
              implemented as a toolbox of the Galaxy bioinformatics platform,
              comprising 6 tools. Theoretical and experimental evaluation has
              shown that the tools of IRProfiler are able to scale well with
              respect to the size of input dataset(s). IRProfiler has been
              utilized by a number of recently published studies concerning
              hematological disorders. CONCLUSION: IRProfiler is made freely
              available via 3 distribution channels, including the Galaxy Tool
              Shed. Despite being a new entry in a crowded ecosystem of immune
              repertoire profiling software, IRProfiler founds its added value
              on its support for alternative clonotype definitions in
              conjunction with a combination of properties stemming from its
              user-centric design, namely ease-of-use, ease-of-access,
              exploitability of the output data, and analysis flexibility.",

              (ustekinumab) and inhibit cytokine signalling pathways

              personalized strategies to identify which patients should be

              focused on single autoantigens or panels of single autoantigens.
              In this article, we advocate to broaden the focus by addressing
              the entire autoantigen repertoire in a systemic ``omics-like''
              way. This approach aims to capture the enormous biodiversity in
              the sets of targeted antigens and pave the way toward a more
              holistic understanding of the concerted character of
              antibody-related humoral immune responses. Ongoing technological
              progress permits high-throughput screenings of thousands of
              autoantigens in parallel, e.g., via protein microarrays, phage
              display, or immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry. We argue
              that the time is right for combining omics and autoantibody
              screening approaches into ``autoantigenomics'' as a novel omics
              subcategory. In this article, we introduce the concept of
              autoantigenomics, describe its roots and application options, and
              demarcate the method from related holistic approaches such as
              systems serology or immune-related transcriptomics and
              proteomics. We suggest the following extendable method set to be
              applied to autoantigen repertoires: (1) principal component
              analysis, (2) hierarchical cluster analysis, (3) partial
              least-square discriminant analysis or orthogonal projections to
              latent structures discriminant analysis, (4) analysis of the
              repertoire sizes in disease groups and clinical subgroups, (5)
              overrepresentation analyses using databases like those of Gene
              Ontology, Reactome Pathway, or DisGeNET, (6) analysis of pathways
              that are significantly targeted by specific repertoires, and (7)
              machine learning approaches. In an unsupervised way, these
              methods can identify clusters of autoantigens sharing certain
              functional or spatial properties, or clusters of patients
              comprising clinical subgroups potentially useful for patient
              stratification. In a supervised way, these methods can lead to
              prediction models that may eventually assist diagnosis and
              prognosis. The untargeted autoantigenomics approach allows for
              the systematic survey of antibody-related humoral immune
              responses. This may enhance our understanding of autoimmune

              spondyloarthropathy primarily affecting the axial skeleton and
              strongly associated with HLA-B*27 carriage. Genetic evidence
              implicates both autoinflammatory processes and autoimmunity
              against a HLA-B*27-restricted autoantigen in immunopathology.
              Additional to articular symptoms, up to 70\% of AS patients
              present with concurrent bowel inflammation, suggesting that
              adverse interactions between a genetically-primed host immune
              system and the gut microbiome contributes to disease.
              Accordingly, this study aimed to characterise adaptive immune
              responses to antigenic stimuli in AS. METHODS: We profiled the
              peripheral CD4 and CD8 T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of AS
              patients (n=47) and HLA-B*27 matched controls (n=38). We
              estimated repertoire diversity and employed univariate and
              multivariate statistical techniques to characterise AS-associated

              increased TCR diversity (CD4 P=7.8x10-6 , CD8 P=9.3x10-4 ),
              attributed to a significant reduction in the magnitude of
              peripheral T-cell expansions globally, and fewer patient T-cells
              expressed IFN$\gamma$ (CD8 P=0.03) and TNF$\alpha$ (CD4 P=0.01,
              CD8 P=0.002) upon in vitro stimulation. Additionally, the CD8 TCR
              signature was altered, with significantly expanded EBV (P=0.03)
              and CMV-specific (P=0.02) clonotypes and increased incidence of

  abstract = "Our immune system can destroy most cells in our body, an ability
              that needs to be tightly controlled. To prevent autoimmunity, the
              thymic medulla exposes developing T cells to normal ``self''
              peptides and prevents any responders from entering the
              bloodstream. However, a substantial number of self-reactive T
              cells nevertheless reaches the periphery, implying that T cells
              do not encounter all self peptides during this negative selection
              process. It is unclear if T cells can still discriminate foreign
              peptides from self peptides they haven't encountered during
              negative selection. We use an ``artificial immune system''-a
              machine learning model of the T cell repertoire-to investigate
              how negative selection could alter the recognition of self
              peptides that are absent from the thymus. Our model reveals a
              surprising new role for T cell cross-reactivity in this context:
              moderate T cell cross-reactivity should skew the post-selection
              repertoire towards peptides that differ systematically from self.
              Moreover, even some self-like foreign peptides can be
              distinguished provided that the peptides presented in the thymus
              are not too similar to each other. Thus, our model predicts that
              negative selection on a well-chosen subset of self peptides would
              generate a repertoire that tolerates even ``unseen'' self
              peptides better than foreign peptides. This effect would resemble
              a ``generalization'' process as it is found in learning systems.

              (ACs), smoldering, chronic, acute and lymphoma ATL subtypes-and
              three uninfected controls to evaluate TCR distribution. Based on
              these TCR profiles, CD4-positive cells and ACs showed polyclonal
              patterns, whereas ATL patients showed oligo- or monoclonal
              patterns (with 446 average clonotypes across samples). Expression
              of TCR$\alpha$ and TCR$\beta$ genes in the dominant clone
              differed among the samples. ACs, CD4-positive samples and
              smoldering patients showed significantly higher TCR diversity
              compared with chronic, acute and lymphoma subtypes. CDR3 sequence

              useful for prognostic purposes and for personalizing ATL

              Therefore, dysregulation, or improper functioning of these
              cascades, is involved in the induction and progression of
              diseases such as cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and
              developmental abnormalities. Many of these physiological, and
              pathological functions are mediated by MAPK-dependent
              transcription of various regulatory genes. In order to induce
              transcription and the consequent functions, the signals

  abstract = "PURPOSE: The pharmacology, clinical activity, safety, and place
              in therapy of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors
              palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib are reviewed. SUMMARY:
              CDK 4 and CDK 6 are downstream agents in the estrogen signaling
              pathway that control entry into the cell cycle. CDK4/6 inhibition
              may prevent tumor cell progression in the cell cycle. Three
              CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib) are
              available for women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human
              epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced or
              metastatic breast cancer. These medications' indications in the
              treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer include use with an
              aromatase inhibitor (AI) as initial therapy in postmenopausal
              women and with fulvestrant in women whose disease progressed
              during endocrine therapy. Ribociclib is also indicated as initial
              therapy with an AI in premenopausal or perimenopausal women and
              as initial therapy with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women.
              Abemaciclib is also indicated as monotherapy in women with
              disease progression after endocrine therapy and prior
              chemotherapy. A significant increase in progression-free survival
              (PFS) was seen with use of all 3 agents as initial therapy with
              an AI in controlled trials. Each agent also was demonstrated to
              produce a significant increase in PFS when used with fulvestrant
              in women whose disease progressed with prior endocrine therapy.
              Neutropenia is a dose-limiting adverse effect of palbociclib and
              ribociclib. Fatigue is more common with use of palbociclib and
              abemaciclib, and gastrointestinal effects are more common with
              abemaciclib use. CONCLUSION: CDK4/6 inhibitors have significant
              demonstrated clinical activity in combination with AIs or
              fulvestrant in women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast

              concentrations (IC50) of PD-0332991 were determined with cell
              line proliferation assays, as were its effects on the cell cycle,

              cancer previously treated with chemotherapy and endocrine

              treatment of metastatic breast cancer by targeting the cell cycle
              machinery, interrupting intracellular and mitogenic hormone
              signals that stimulate proliferation of malignant cells.
              Preclinical evidence demonstrated that derangements of cyclin D1,
              CDK4/6, and retinoblastoma expression are common in breast
              cancer, and suggested a therapeutic benefit from interrupting
              this axis required for cell cycle progression. Studies of cell
              lines and animal models of breast cancer have demonstrated the
              complex interplay between the cell cycle and estrogen receptor
              and human epidermal growth receptor 2 signaling, which informs
              our understanding of synergistic use of CDK4/6 inhibitors with
              endocrine therapy, as well as mechanisms of resistance to
              endocrine therapy. Interestingly, estrogen receptor activity
              leads to upregulation of cyclin D1 expression, but the estrogen
              receptor is also in turn activated by cyclin D1, independent of
              estrogen binding. Early CDK inhibitors were nonspecific and
              limited by systemic toxicities, while the current generation of
              CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown promise in the treatment of hormone
              receptor-positive breast cancer. Preclinical investigations of
              the three CDK4/6 inhibitors approved by the US Food and Drug

              implicated in human malignancies including breast cancer. PD
              0332991 is an orally active, highly selective inhibitor of the
              cyclin D kinases (CDK)4 and CDK6 with ability to block
              retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation in the low nanomolar range.
              To identify predictors of response, we determined the in vitro
              sensitivity to PD 0332991 across a panel of molecularly
              characterized human breast cancer cell lines. METHODS:
              Forty-seven human breast cancer and immortalized cell lines
              representing the known molecular subgroups of breast cancer were
              treated with PD 0332991 to determine IC50 values. These data were
              analyzed against baseline gene expression data to identify genes
              associated with PD 0332991 response. RESULTS: Cell lines
              representing luminal estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subtype
              (including those that are HER2 amplified) were most sensitive to
              growth inhibition by PD 0332991 while nonluminal/basal subtypes
              were most resistant. Analysis of variance identified 450
              differentially expressed genes between sensitive and resistant
              cells. pRb and cyclin D1 were elevated and CDKN2A (p16) was
              decreased in the most sensitive lines. Cell cycle analysis showed
              G0/G1 arrest in sensitive cell lines and Western blot analysis
              demonstrated that Rb phosphorylation is blocked in sensitive
              lines but not resistant lines. PD 0332991 was synergistic with
              tamoxifen and trastuzumab in ER+ and HER2-amplified cell lines,
              respectively. PD 0332991 enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen in
              cell lines with conditioned resistance to ER blockade.
              CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest a role for CDK4/6 inhibition
              in some breast cancers and identify criteria for patient
              selection in clinical studies of PD 0332991",

  author   = "Haider, Saad and Pal, Ranadip",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Numerous approaches exist for modeling of genetic
              regulatory networks (GRNs) but the low sampling rates often
              employed in biological studies prevents the inference of detailed
              models from experimental data. In this paper, we analyze the
              issues involved in estimating a model of a GRN from single cell
              line time series data with limited time points. RESULTS: We
              present an inference approach for a Boolean Network (BN) model of
              a GRN from limited transcriptomic or proteomic time series data
              based on prior biological knowledge of connectivity, constraints
              on attractor structure and robust design. We applied our
              inference approach to 6 time point transcriptomic data on Human
              Mammary Epithelial Cell line (HMEC) after application of
              Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and generated a BN with a plausible
              biological structure satisfying the data. We further defined and
              applied a similarity measure to compare synthetic BNs and BNs
              generated through the proposed approach constructed from
              transitions of various paths of the synthetic BNs. We have also
              compared the performance of our algorithm with two existing BN
              inference algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: Through theoretical analysis
              and simulations, we showed the rarity of arriving at a BN from
              limited time series data with plausible biological structure
              using random connectivity and absence of structure in data. The
              framework when applied to experimental data and data generated
              from synthetic BNs were able to estimate BNs with high similarity
              scores. Comparison with existing BN inference algorithms showed
              the better performance of our proposed algorithm for limited time
              series data. The proposed framework can also be applied to
              optimize the connectivity of a GRN from experimental data when
              the prior biological knowledge on regulators is limited or not
              unique.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Despite promising progress in targeted breast cancer
              therapy, drug resistance remains challenging. The monoclonal
              antibody drugs trastuzumab and pertuzumab as well as the small
              molecule inhibitor erlotinib were designed to prevent ErbB-2 and
              ErbB-1 receptor induced deregulated protein signalling,
              contributing to tumour progression. The oncogenic potential of
              ErbB receptors unfolds in case of overexpression or mutations.
              Dimerisation with other receptors allows to bypass pathway
              blockades. Our intention is to reconstruct the ErbB network to
              reveal resistance mechanisms. We used longitudinal proteomic data
              of ErbB receptors and downstream targets in the ErbB-2 amplified
              breast cancer cell lines BT474, SKBR3 and HCC1954 treated with
              erlotinib, trastuzumab or pertuzumab, alone or combined, up to 60
              minutes and 30 hours, respectively. In a Boolean modelling
              approach, signalling networks were reconstructed based on these
              data in a cell line and time course specific manner, including
              prior literature knowledge. Finally, we simulated network
              response to inhibitor combinations to detect signalling nodes
              reflecting growth inhibition. RESULTS: The networks pointed to
              cell line specific activation patterns of the MAPK and PI3K
              pathway. In BT474, the PI3K signal route was favoured, while in
              SKBR3, novel edges highlighted MAPK signalling. In HCC1954, the
              inferred edges stimulated both pathways. For example, we
              uncovered feedback loops amplifying PI3K signalling, in line with
              the known trastuzumab resistance of this cell line. In the
              perturbation simulations on the short-term networks, we analysed
              ERK1/2, AKT and p70S6K. The results indicated a pathway specific
              drug response, driven by the type of growth factor stimulus.
              HCC1954 revealed an edgetic type of PIK3CA-mutation, contributing
              to trastuzumab inefficacy. Drug impact on the AKT and ERK1/2
              signalling axes is mirrored by effects on RB and RPS6, relating
              to phenotypic events like cell growth or proliferation.
              Therefore, we additionally analysed RB and RPS6 in the long-term
              networks. CONCLUSIONS: We derived protein interaction models for
              three breast cancer cell lines. Changes compared to the common
              reference network hint towards individual characteristics and
              potential drug resistance mechanisms. Simulation of perturbations
              were consistent with the experimental data, confirming our
              combined reverse and forward engineering approach as valuable for
              drug discovery and personalised medicine.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Identifying predictive factors for the clinical outcome
              of patients with lower grade gliomas following radiotherapy could
              help optimize patient treatments. Here, we investigate the
              predictive efficacy of both a previously identified ``31-gene
              signature'' and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression.
              MATERIAL AND METHODS: We identified 511 patients with lower grade
              glioma (Grade 2 and 3) in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset and
              divided them into two clusters: radiosensitive (RS) and
              radioresistant (RR). Patients were also classified as PD-L1-high
              or PD-L1-low based on CD274 mRNA expression. Five-year survival
              rates were compared across patient groups, and differentially
              expressed genes were identified via a gene enrichment analysis.
              RESULTS: Among 511 patients with lower grade glioma in The Cancer
              Genome Atlas dataset, we identified a group that was
              characterized by radioresistant and high PD-L1 (the PD-L1-high-RR
              group). Multivariate Cox models demonstrated that the membership
              in the PD-L1-high-RR can predict overall survival regarding to
              RT. Differentially expressed genes associated with the
              PD-L1-high-RR group were found to play a role in the immune
              response, including the T-cell receptor signaling pathway.
              CONCLUSION: We tested the predictive value of a ``31-gene
              signature'' and PD-L1 expression status in a dataset of patients
              with lower grade glioma. Our results suggest that the patient
              population classified as the PD-L1-high-RR may benefit most from
              radiotherapy combined with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Prospective

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Contamination of reagents and cross contamination
              across samples is a long-recognized issue in molecular biology
              laboratories. While often innocuous, contamination can lead to
              inaccurate results. Cantalupo et al., for example, found
              HeLa-derived human papillomavirus 18 (H-HPV18) in several of The
              Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-sequencing samples. This work
              motivated us to assess a greater number of samples and determine
              the origin of possible contaminations using viral sequences. To
              detect viruses with high specificity, we developed the publicly
              available workflow, VirDetect, that detects virus and laboratory
              vector sequences in RNA-seq samples. We applied VirDetect to 9143
              RNA-seq samples sequenced at one TCGA sequencing center (28/33
              cancer types) over 5 years. RESULTS: We confirmed that H-HPV18
              was present in many samples and determined that viral transcripts
              from H-HPV18 significantly co-occurred with those from xenotropic
              mouse leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV). Using laboratory
              metadata and viral transcription, we determined that the likely
              contaminant was a pool of cell lines known as the ``common
              reference'', which was sequenced alongside TCGA RNA-seq samples
              as a control to monitor quality across technology transitions
              (i.e. microarray to GAII to HiSeq), and to link RNA-seq to
              previous generation microarrays that standardly used the ``common
              reference''. One of the cell lines in the pool was a laboratory
              isolate of MCF-7, which we discovered was infected with XMRV;
              another constituent of the pool was likely HeLa cells.
              CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, this indicates a multi-step
              contamination process. First, MCF-7 was infected with an XMRV.
              Second, this infected cell line was added to a pool of cell
              lines, which contained HeLa. Finally, RNA from this pool of cell
              lines contaminated several TCGA tumor samples most-likely during
              library construction. Thus, these human tumors with H-HPV or XMRV
              reads were likely not infected with H-HPV 18 or XMRV.",

              to understanding the origin and fate of T cells in tumour

              GuideScan software is developed to design CRISPR guide RNA
              libraries, which can be used for genome editing of coding and
              non-coding genomic regions effectively. However, GuideScan is a
              serial program and computationally expensive for designing CRISPR
              guide RNA libraries from large genomes. Here, we present an
              efficient guide RNA library designing tool (MultiGuideScan) by
              implementing multiple processes of GuideScan. MultiGuideScan
              speeds up the guide RNA library designing about 9-12 times on a

              The conventional approach of high throughput screening of

              replaced by RNAi technology. CRISPR/Cas9, an RNA guided
              endonuclease system is the most recent technology for this work.
              Here, we have discussed the major considerations involved in
              designing a CRISPR/Cas9 based screening experiment for
              identification of synthetic lethal targets. It mainly includes
              CRISPR library to be used, cell types for conducting the

              selecting the desired phenotypes from the complete cell

              clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4-5 driver mutations
              when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however,
              in around 5\% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting
              that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis,
              in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single
              catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour
              evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede
              most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated
              genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance
              often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and

              while a perturbation of either gene alone is not lethal. SL
              reflects the biologically endogenous difference between cancer
              cells and normal cells, and thus the inhibition of SL partners of
              genes with cancer-specific mutations could selectively kill
              cancer cells but spare normal cells. Therefore, SL is emerging as

              the drawbacks of traditional chemotherapies by reducing severe
              side effects. Researchers have developed experimental

              in colorectal cancer is currently restricted to a minority of
              patients diagnosed with mismatch repair-deficient tumors having
              high mutation burden. However, this observation does not exclude
              the existence of neoantigen-specific T cells in colorectal
              cancers with low mutation burden and the exploitation of their
              anti-cancer potential for immunotherapy. Therefore, we
              investigated whether autologous neoantigen-specific T cell
              responses could also be observed in patients diagnosed with
              mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers. METHODS:
              Whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing were performed on cancer
              and normal tissues from seven colorectal cancer patients
              diagnosed with mismatch repair-proficient tumors to detect
              putative neoantigens. Corresponding neo-epitopes were synthesized
              and tested for recognition by in vitro expanded T cells that were
              isolated from tumor tissues (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) and
              from peripheral mononuclear blood cells stimulated with tumor
              material. RESULTS: Neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity was
              detected to several neo-epitopes in the tumor-infiltrating
              lymphocytes of three patients while their respective cancers
              expressed 15, 21, and 30 non-synonymous variants. Cell sorting of
              tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes based on the co-expression of CD39
              and CD103 pinpointed the presence of neoantigen-specific T cells
              in the CD39+CD103+ T cell subset. Strikingly, the tumors
              containing neoantigen-reactive TIL were classified as consensus
              molecular subtype 4 (CMS4), which is associated with TGF-$\beta$
              pathway activation and worse clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We

              cells in mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers of the

  abstract = "Synthetic lethality exploits the phenomenon that a mutation in a
              cancer gene is often associated with new vulnerability which can
              be uniquely targeted therapeutically, leading to a significant
              increase in favorable outcome. DNA damage and survival pathways
              are among the most commonly mutated networks in human cancers.
              Recent data suggest that synthetic lethal interactions between a
              tumor defect and a DNA repair pathway can be used to
              preferentially kill tumor cells. We recently published a method,
              DiscoverSL, using multi-omic cancer data, that can predict
              synthetic lethal interactions of potential clinical relevance.
              Here, we apply the generality of our models in a comprehensive
              web tool called Synthetic Lethality Bio Discovery Portal
              (SL-BioDP) and extend the cancer types to 18 cancer genome atlas
              cohorts. SL-BioDP enables a data-driven computational approach to
              predict synthetic lethal interactions from hallmark cancer
              pathways by mining cancer's genomic and chemical interactions.
              Our tool provides queries and visualizations for exploring
              potentially targetable synthetic lethal interactions, shows
              Kaplan-Meier plots of clinical relevance, and provides in silico
              validation using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and drug efficacy
              data. Our method would thus shed light on mechanisms of synthetic

              progression, and are subjected to radiation, cytotoxic, or more
              recently targeted therapies with limited success. Synthetic

              in loss of viability of cancer cells have been exploited to treat
              malignancies resulting from defects in certain DDR pathways.
              Albeit being a promising therapeutic strategy, number of SL based
              drugs currently in clinical trial is limited. In this work we
              performed a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of alterations in
              10 DDR pathways with different components of DNA repair. Using
              unsupervised clustering of single sample enrichment of these
              pathways in 7,272 tumor samples from 17 tumor types from TCGA, we
              identified three prominent clusters, each associated with
              specific DDR mechanisms. Somatic mutations in key DDR genes were
              found to be dominant in each of these three clusters with
              distinct DDR component. Using a machine-learning based algorithm
              we predicted SL partners specific to somatic mutations in key
              genes representing each of the three DDR clusters and identified
              potential druggable targets. We explored the potential
              FDA-approved drugs for targeting the predicted SL genes and
              tested the sensitivity using the drug screening data in cell
              lines with mutation in the primary DDR genes. We have shown
              clinical relevance, for selected targetable SL interactions using
              Kaplan-Meier analysis in terms of improved disease-free survival.
              Thus, our computational framework provides a basis for clinically

              different tumor types using genomic platforms and to make these
              data, both raw and processed, available to all researchers. TCGA
              data are currently over 1.2 Petabyte in size and include whole
              genome sequence (WGS), whole exome sequence, methylation, RNA
              expression, proteomic, and clinical datasets. Publicly accessible
              TCGA data are released through public portals, but many
              challenges exist in navigating and using data obtained from these
              sites. We developed TCGA Expedition to support the research
              community focused on computational methods for cancer research.
              Data obtained, versioned, and archived using TCGA Expedition
              supports command line access at high-performance computing
              facilities as well as some functionality with third party tools.
              For a subset of TCGA data collected at University of Pittsburgh,
              we also re-associate TCGA data with de-identified data from the
              electronic health records. Here we describe the software as well
              as the architecture of our repository, methods for loading of
              TCGA data to multiple platforms, and security and regulatory
              controls that conform to federal best practices. RESULTS: TCGA
              Expedition software consists of a set of scripts written in Bash,
              Python and Java that download, extract, harmonize, version and
              store all TCGA data and metadata. The software generates a
              versioned, participant- and sample-centered, local TCGA data
              directory with metadata structures that directly reference the
              local data files as well as the original data files. The software
              supports flexible searches of the data via a web portal,
              user-centric data tracking tools, and data provenance tools.
              Using this software, we created a collaborative repository, the
              Pittsburgh Genome Resource Repository (PGRR) that enabled
              investigators at our institution to work with all TCGA data
              formats, and to interrogate these data with analysis pipelines,
              and associated tools. WGS data are especially challenging for
              individual investigators to use, due to issues with downloading,
              storage, and processing; having locally accessible WGS BAM files
              has proven invaluable. CONCLUSION: Our open-source, freely
              available TCGA Expedition software can be used to create a local
              collaborative infrastructure for acquiring, managing, and
              analyzing TCGA data and other large public datasets.",

  abstract = "Synthetic lethal interactions (SLIs) are robust mechanisms that
              provide cells with the ability to remain viable despite having
              mutations in genes critical to the DNA damage response, a core
              cellular process. Studies in model organisms such as S.
              cerevisiae showed that thousands of genes important in
              maintaining DNA integrity cooperated in a SLI network. Two genes
              participate in a SLI when a mutation in one gene has no effect on
              the cell, but mutations in both interacting genes are lethal.
              Furthermore in C. elegans, a mutation in a critical gene that is
              important for development induced a change in expression
              variability in the synthetic lethal interactor. In cancer,
              targeting SLIs shows promise in selectively killing cancer cells.
              For example, targeting PARP1 is an effective treatment for
              BRCA1/2- breast and ovarian cancers. Although PARP1 is already
              identified as having a SLI with BRCA1/2-, computationally
              searching for other genes that cooperate in the SLI network could
              highlight genes that may have promise for being a cancer-specific

              patients with BRCA2 mutations and the R Bioconductor package

              invariant, stable expression state are likely candidates for SLIs

              analyzing expression variability to computationally identify

              The LYRA (LYmphocyte Receptor Automated modeling) web server
              (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/LYRA/) implements a complete and

              The webserver is freely available and easy to use for
              non-specialists. Upon submission, LYRA automatically generates
              alignments using ad hoc profiles, predicts the structural class
              of each hypervariable loop, selects the best templates in an
              automatic fashion, and provides within minutes a complete 3D

              users can manually select or exclude template structures
              according to case specific information. LYRA is based on the
              canonical structure method, that in the last 30 years has been
              successfully used to generate antibody models of high accuracy,
              and in our benchmarks this approach proves to achieve similarly

              (hMSC-Exo) have been shown to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury
              (I/R) in multiple models. I/R-induced apoptosis or autophagy play
              important roles in cell death. However, little or no reports
              demonstrate any roles of hMSC-Exo in this regards. OBJECTIVE: To
              test the hypothesis that the inhibition of I/R-induced apoptosis
              and autophagy play a pivotal role in the cardioprotection of
              hMSC-Exo. METHODS: Myoblast H9c2 cells and isolated rat hearts
              underwent hypoxia/re-oxygenate (H/R) or ischemia/ reperfusion
              (I/R) respectively. H9c2 were treated with 1.0 $\mu$g/ml Exo, in
              comparison with 3-MA or rapamycin (Rapa), a known anti- or
              pro-autophagic agent respectively. Hearts were treated with 0.5,
              1.0 and 2.0 $\mu$g/ml Exo for 20 min in the beginning of
              reperfusion. Cell viability, WST assay, LDH release, Annexin-V
              staining apoptosis assay and GFP-LC3 labeled autophagosomes
              formation, cardiac function and Western blot were measured.
              RESULTS: Exo significantly reduced H/R injury as indicated by
              increased cell viability and reduced LDH and apoptosis. 3-MA,
              while Rapa, showed increased or decreased protective effects.
              Rapa-induced injury was partially blocked by Exo. Exo decreased
              LC3-II/I ratio and increased p62, inhibited autophagosome
              formation, an indication of autophagy inhibition. In isolated
              heart, Exo increased cardiac functional recovery and reduced LDH
              release in I/R. Bcl-2 was significantly upregulated by Exo but
              not 3-MA. Exo downregulated Traf6 and upregulated mTORC1/p-4eBP1.
              CONCLUSION: Exo reduce I/R-induced apoptosis and autophagy.
              Up-regulation of Bcl-2 is the cross-talk between these two

              from stored red blood cell (RBC) unit and their potential
              function. Materials and Methods: Exosomes were isolated from the
              supernatant derived from stored RBC units by sequential
              centrifugation. Isolated exosomes were characterized by TEM
              (transmission electron microscopy), western blotting, and DLS
              (dynamic light scattering). MicroRNA (miRNA) microarray was
              performed to detect the expression of miRNAs in 3 exosome
              samples. Results revealed miRNAs that were simultaneously
              expressed in the 3 exosome samples and were previously reported
              to exist in mature RBCs. Functions and potential pathways of some
              detected miRNAs were illustrated by bioinformatic analysis.
              Validation of the top 3 abundant miRNAs was carried out by
              qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
              reaction). Results: TEM and DLS revealed the mean size of the
              exosomes (RBC-derived) as 64.08 nm. These exosomes exhibited
              higher abundance of short RNA than the long RNA. 78 miRNAs were
              simultaneously detected in 3 exosome samples and mature RBCs.
              Several biological processes might be impacted by these miRNAs,
              through their target gene(s) enriched in a particular signalling
              pathway. The top 3 (abundant) miRNAs detected were as follows:
              miR-125b-5p, miR-4454, and miR-451a. qRT-PCR revealed higher
              abundance of miR-451a than others. Only miR-4454 and miR-451a
              abundance tended to increase with increasing storage time.
              Conclusion: Exosomes derived from stored RBC units possessed
              multiple miRNAs and, hence, could serve various functions. The

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: A gene set test is a differential expression analysis
              in which a P-value is assigned to a set of genes as a unit. Gene
              set tests are valuable for increasing statistical power,
              organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression
              patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based
              on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes
              unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that
              rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group
              comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group.
              RESULTS: We present ROAST, a statistically rigorous gene set test
              that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to
              almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, ROAST
              uses rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate
              regression. Since the number of rotations does not depend on
              sample size, ROAST gives useful results even for experiments with
              minimal replication. ROAST allows for any experimental design
              that can be expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate
              array weights and correlated samples. ROAST can be tuned for
              situations in which only a subset of the genes in the set are
              actively involved in the molecular pathway. ROAST can test for
              uni- or bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to
              allow for prior importance. The power and size of the ROAST
              procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to
              that of a representative permutation method. Finally, ROAST is
              used to test the degree of transcriptional conservation between
              human and mouse mammary stems. AVAILABILITY: ROAST is implemented
              as a function in the Bioconductor package limma available from

                     question is raised about the consistency of the results of

                     a systematic analysis of ten commonly used gene set
                     analysis methods when applied to microarray data. The
                     statistical analysis suggests that there is a significant

                     Comparison of the 20 most statistically significant gene

              Exosomes, which are released from multi-vesicular bodies upon
              fusion with the plasma membrane, and ectosomes, which directly
              bud from the plasma membrane. How cells regulate the quantity of
              EV release is largely unknown. One of the initiating events in

              from the exoplasmic to the cytosolic leaflet of biological
              membranes. This process is catalyzed by P4-ATPases. The role of

               neo-antigen only or wild type antigen only or double positive T

               paired a and b chain sequences can be obtained in more than 80\%
               of single T cells. Simultaneous tetramer DNA barcode sequencing
               showed that many T cells are found to cross-reactive to both
               neo-antigen and its wild type counterpart, suggesting the
               necessity of strict screening for neo-antigen only TCR in

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular
              framework for condensing information from gene expression
              profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of
              this approach over single gene analysis include noise and
              dimension reduction, as well as greater biological
              interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond
              simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE
              methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within
              highly heterogeneous data sets. RESULTS: To address this
              challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE
              method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample
              population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the
              robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art
              sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of
              its utility in differential pathway activity and survival
              analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data
              from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments. CONCLUSIONS: GSVA
              provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity
              changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding
              methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points
              of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to
              build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA
              contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data.
              GSVA is an open source software package for R which forms part of
              the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at

              functionally equivalent genes across multiple species. At the
              same time, in silico orthology prediction tools often require
              large computational resources only available on computing
              clusters. Here we present OrthoReD, an open-source orthology
              prediction tool with accuracy comparable to published tools that
              requires only a desktop computer. The low computational resource
              requirement of OrthoReD is achieved by repeating orthology
              searches on one gene of interest at a time, thereby generating a
              reduced dataset to limit the scope of orthology search for each
              gene of interest. RESULTS: The output of OrthoReD was highly
              similar to the outputs of two other published orthology
              prediction tools, OrthologID and/or OrthoDB, for the three

              of orthologs sequences is of great importance for computational
              biology, annotation of genomes and for phylogenetic inference.
              Since 2007, with the increase in the number of new sequences
              being deposited in large biological databases, researchers have
              begun to analyse computerized methodologies and tools aimed at
              selecting the most promising ones in the prediction of
              orthologous groups. Literature in this field of research
              describes the problems that the majority of available tools show,
              such as those encountered in accuracy, time required for analysis
              (especially in light of the increasing volume of data being
              submitted, which require faster techniques) and the
              automatization of the process without requiring manual
              intervention. Conducting our search through BMC, Google Scholar,
              NCBI PubMed, and Expasy, we examined more than 600 articles
              pursuing the most recent techniques and tools developed to solve
              most the problems still existing in orthology detection. We
              listed the main computational tools created and developed between
              2011 and 2017, taking into consideration the differences in the
              type of orthology analysis, outlining the main features of each
              tool and pointing to the problems that each one tries to address.
              We also observed that several tools still use as their main
              algorithm the BLAST ``all-against-all'' methodology, which
              entails some limitations, such as limited number of queries,
              computational cost, and high processing time to complete the
              analysis. However, new promising tools are being developed, like
              OrthoVenn (which uses the Venn diagram to show the relationship
              of ortholog groups generated by its algorithm); or proteinOrtho
              (which improves the accuracy of ortholog groups); or ReMark
              (tackling the integration of the pipeline to turn the entry

              using four for prokaryotic genomas. We hope that our review can
              be useful for researchers and will help them in selecting the

              gene (or protein) to another. Hence, detecting orthology

              Various genomic events, such as duplication and horizontal gene

              widely used to identify the role of genes involved in biological
              conditions of interest. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are regulatory
              molecules that have been functionally associated with several
              developmental programs and their deregulation with diverse
              diseases including cancer. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
              Although miRNA expression levels may not be routinely measured in
              high-throughput experiments, a possible involvement of miRNAs in
              the deregulation of gene expression can be computationally
              predicted and quantified through analysis of overrepresented
              motifs in the deregulated genes 3' untranslated region (3'UTR)
              sequences. Here, we introduce a user-friendly web-server,
              DIANA-mirExTra (www.microrna.gr/mirextra) that allows the
              comparison of frequencies of miRNA associated motifs between sets
              of genes that can lead to the identification of miRNAs
              responsible for the deregulation of large numbers of genes. To
              this end, we have investigated different approaches and measures,
              and have practically implemented them on experimental data.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: On several datasets of miRNA
              overexpression and repression experiments, our proposed
              approaches have successfully identified the deregulated miRNA.
              Beyond the prediction of miRNAs responsible for the deregulation
              of transcripts, the web-server provides extensive links to
              DIANA-mirPath, a functional analysis tool incorporating miRNA
              targets in biological pathways. Additionally, in case information

              with our previously published cDNA array and Affymetrix HU6800
              data sets, we first developed a ``consensus set'' of transcript

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs
              affecting the expression of target genes via translational
              repression or mRNA degradation mechanisms. With the increasing
              availability of mRNA and miRNA expression data, it might be
              possible to assess functional targets using the fact that a miRNA
              might down-regulate its target mRNAs. In this work we computed
              the correlation of expression profiles between miRNAs and target
              mRNAs using the NCI-60 expression data. The aim is to investigate
              whether the correlations between miRNA and mRNA expression
              profiles, either positive or negative, can be used to assist the
              identification of functional miRNA-mRNA relationships. RESULTS:
              Predicted miRNA-mRNA interactions were taken from TargetScan 4.1
              and miRBase release 5. Pearson correlation coefficients between
              the miRNA and the mRNA expression profiles were computed using
              NCI-60 data. The correlation coefficients were then subject to
              the Benjamini and Hochberg correction. Our results show that the
              percentage of TargetScan-predicted miRNA-mRNA interactions having
              negative correlation in expression profiles is higher than that
              of miRBase-predicted pairs. Using the experimentally validated
              miRNA targets listed in TarBase, genes involved in mRNA
              degradation show more negative correlations between miRNA and
              mRNA expression profiles, comparing with genes involved in
              translational repression. Furthermore, correlation analysis for
              miRNAs and mRNAs transcribed from the same genes shows that
              correlations of expression profiles between intronic miRNAs and
              host genes tend to be positive. Finally we found that a target
              gene might be down-regulated by more than one miRNAs sharing the
              same seed region. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that expression
              profiles can be used in the computational identification of
              functional miRNA-target associations. One can expect a higher
              chance of finding negatively correlated expression profiles for
              TargetScan-predicted interactions than for miRBase-predicted
              ones. With limited experimentally validated miRNA-target
              interactions, expression profiles can only serve as a
              supplementary role in finding interactions between miRNAs and
              mRNAs.",

  abstract = "Background: Motif analysis methods have long been central for
              studying biological function of nucleotide sequences. Functional
              genomics experiments extend their potential. They typically
              generate sequence lists ranked by an experimentally acquired
              functional property such as gene expression or protein binding
              affinity. Current motif discovery tools suffer from limitations
              in searching large motif spaces, and thus more complex motifs may
              not be included. There is thus a need for motif analysis methods
              that are tailored for analyzing specific complex motifs motivated
              by biological questions and hypotheses rather than acting as a
              screen based motif finding tool. Methods: We present Regmex
              (REGular expression Motif EXplorer), which offers several methods
              to identify overrepresented motifs in ranked lists of sequences.
              Regmex uses regular expressions to define motifs or families of
              motifs and embedded Markov models to calculate exact p-values for
              motif observations in sequences. Biases in motif distributions
              across ranked sequence lists are evaluated using random walks,
              Brownian bridges, or modified rank based statistics. A modular
              setup and fast analytic p value evaluations make Regmex
              applicable to diverse and potentially large-scale motif analysis
              problems. Results: We demonstrate use cases of combined motifs on
              simulated data and on expression data from micro RNA transfection
              experiments. We confirm previously obtained results and
              demonstrate the usability of Regmex to test a specific hypothesis

              motifs. We further compare the tool with an existing motif

              Regmex is a useful and flexible tool to analyze motif hypotheses
              that relates to large data sets in functional genomics. The

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic
              liver disease by infecting over 170 million people worldwide.
              Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of
              small non-coding regulatory RNAs, are involved in the regulation
              of HCV infection, but their functions have not been
              systematically studied. We propose an integrative strategy for
              identifying the miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules that are associated
              with HCV infection. This strategy combines paired expression
              profiles of miRNAs and mRNAs and computational target
              predictions. A miRNA-mRNA regulatory module consists of a set of
              miRNAs and their targets, in which the miRNAs are predicted to
              coordinately regulate the level of the target mRNA. RESULTS: We
              simultaneously profiled the expression of cellular miRNAs and
              mRNAs across 30 HCV positive or negative human liver biopsy
              samples using microarray technology. We constructed a miRNA-mRNA
              regulatory network, and using a graph theoretical approach,
              identified 38 miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules in the network that
              were associated with HCV infection. We evaluated the direct miRNA
              regulation of the mRNA levels of targets in regulatory modules
              using previously published miRNA transfection data. We analyzed
              the functional roles of individual modules at the systems level
              by integrating a large-scale protein interaction network. We
              found that various biological processes, including some HCV
              infection related canonical pathways, were regulated at the miRNA
              level during HCV infection. CONCLUSION: Our regulatory modules
              provide a framework for future experimental analyses. This report
              demonstrates the utility of our approach to obtain new insights

              genes involved in various biological processes, and may play
              oncogenic or tumor suppressive roles. Many studies have
              investigated the relationships between miRNAs and their target
              genes, using mRNA and miRNA expression data. However, mRNA
              expression levels do not necessarily represent the exact gene
              expression profiles, since protein translation may be regulated
              in several different ways. Despite this, large-scale protein
              expression data have been integrated rarely when predicting
              gene-miRNA relationships. This study explores two approaches for
              the investigation of gene-miRNA relationships by integrating mRNA
              expression and protein expression data. First, miRNAs were ranked
              according to their effects on cancer development. We calculated
              influence scores for each miRNA, based on the number of
              significant mRNA-miRNA and protein-miRNA correlations.
              Furthermore, we constructed modules containing mRNAs, proteins,
              and miRNAs, in which these three molecular types are highly
              correlated. The regulatory interactions between miRNA and genes
              in these modules have been validated based on the direct
              regulations, indirect regulations, and co-regulations through
              transcription factors. We applied our approaches to glioblastomas
              (GBMs), ranked miRNAs depending on their effects on GBM, and
              obtained 52 GBM-related modules. Compared with the miRNA rankings
              and modules constructed using only mRNA expression data, the
              rankings and modules constructed using mRNA and protein
              expression data were shown to have better performance.
              Additionally, we experimentally verified that miR-504, highly
              ranked and included in the identified modules, plays a
              suppressive role in GBM development. We demonstrated that the
              integration of both expression profiles allows a more precise
              analysis of gene-miRNA interactions and the identification of a
              higher number of cancer-related miRNAs and regulatory mechanisms.",

              ischemic injury4,5. Here we examined the mechanistic basis for
              cell therapy in mice after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and
              while heart function was enhanced, it was not associated with new
              cardiomyocyte production. Cell therapy improved heart function
              through an acute sterile immune response characterized by the
              temporal and regional induction of CCR2+ and CX3CR1+ macrophages.
              Intra-cardiac injection of 2 distinct types of adult stem cells,
              freeze/thaw-killed cells or a chemical inducer of the innate
              immune response similarly induced regional CCR2+ and CX3CR1+
              macrophage accumulation and provided functional rejuvenation to
              the I/R-injured heart. This selective macrophage response altered
              cardiac fibroblast activity, reduced border zone extracellular
              matrix (ECM) content, and enhanced the mechanical properties of
              the injured area. The functional benefit of cardiac cell therapy
              is thus due to an acute inflammatory-based wound healing response
              that rejuvenates the mechanical properties of the infarcted area
              of the heart.",

              deeply measured molecular data from thousands of tumor samples.
              In particular, gene expression measures, both within and across
              cancer types, have been used to determine the genes and proteins
              that are active in tumor cells. Results: To more thoroughly
              investigate the behavior of gene expression in TCGA tumor
              samples, we introduce a statistical framework for partitioning
              the variation in gene expression due to a variety of molecular
              variables including somatic mutations, transcription factors

  abstract = "ABSTRACT Copy number aberration events such as amplifications and
              deletions in chromosomal regions are prevalent in cancer
              patients. Frequently aberrated copy number regions include
              regulators such as microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate downstream
              target genes that involve in the important biological processes
              in tumorigenesis and proliferation. Many previous studies
              explored the miRNA-gene interaction networks but copy
              number-derived miRNA regulations are limited. Identifying copy
              number-derived miRNA-target gene regulatory interactions in
              cancer could shed some light on biological mechanisms in tumor
              initiation and progression. In the present study, we developed a
              computational pipeline, called miRDriver which is based on the
              hypothesis that copy number data from cancer patients can be
              utilized to discover driver miRNAs of cancer. miRDriver
              integrates copy number aberration, DNA methylation, gene and
              miRNA expression datasets to compute copy number-derived
              miRNA-gene interactions in cancer. We tested miRDriver on breast
              cancer and ovarian cancer data from the Cancer Genome Atlas

              to be in copy number aberrated regions in breast cancer. We also
              discovered some potentially novel miRNA-gene interactions. Also,
              several miRNAs such as miR-127, miR-139 and let-7b were found to

              inferring gene interactions in 15 specific types of human cancer
              using RNA-Seq expression data and GGM with graphical lasso. We
              take advantage of the corresponding Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
              and Genomes pathway maps to define the subsets of related genes.
              RNA-Seq expression levels of the subsets of genes in solid

              the traditional view in developmental biology that a cell's

              Direct experimental evidence, beginning with the somatic cell
              nuclear transfer experiments of the twentieth century and
              culminating in the more recent breakthroughs in
              transdifferentiation and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)

              cell fate transformation. Research is ongoing in the manipulation
              of cell fate for basic research in disease modeling, drug
              discovery, and clinical therapeutics. In many of these cell fate
              reprogramming experiments, there is often little known about the
              genetic and molecular changes accompanying the reprogramming
              process. However, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) can in some
              cases be implicated in the switching of phenotypes, providing a
              starting point for understanding the dynamic changes that
              accompany a given cell fate reprogramming process. In this

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in
              bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene
              co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for
              describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray
              samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be
              used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes,
              for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an
              intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to
              external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and
              for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks
              facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used
              to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These
              methods have been successfully applied in various biological
              contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and
              analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation
              network methodology have been described in separate publications,
              there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and
              consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
              RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive
              collection of R functions for performing various aspects of
              weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes
              functions for network construction, module detection, gene
              selection, calculations of topological properties, data
              simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external
              software. Along with the R package we also present R software

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short nucleotides that interact
              with their target genes through 3' untranslated regions (UTRs).
              The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) harbors an increasing amount of
              cancer genome data for both tumor and normal samples. However,
              there are few visualization tools focusing on concurrently
              displaying important relationships and attributes between miRNAs
              and mRNAs of both cancer tumor and normal samples. Moreover, a
              deep investigation of miRNA-mRNA target and biological
              relationships across multiple cancer types by integrating
              web-based analysis has not been thoroughly conducted. RESULTS: We
              developed an interactive visualization tool called MMiRNA-Viewer
              that can concurrently present the co-relationships of expression
              between miRNA-mRNA pairs of both tumor and normal samples into a
              single graph. The input file of MMiRNA-Viewer contains the
              expression information including fold changes between normal and
              tumor samples for mRNAs and miRNAs, the correlation between mRNA
              and miRNA, and the predicted target relationship by a number of
              databases. Users can also load their own input data into
              MMiRNA-Viewer and visualize and compare detailed information
              about cancer-related gene expression changes, and also changes in
              the expression of transcription-regulating miRNAs. To validate
              the MMiRNA-Viewer, eight types of TCGA cancer datasets with both
              normal and control samples were selected in this study and three
              filter steps were applied subsequently. We performed Gene
              Ontology (GO) analysis for genes available in final selected 238
              pairs and also for genes in the top 5 \% (95 percentile) for each
              of eight cancer types to report a significant number of genes
              involved in various biological functions and pathways. We also
              calculated various centrality measurement matrices for the
              largest connected component(s) in each of eight cancers and
              reported top genes and miRNAs with high centrality measurements.
              CONCLUSIONS: With its user-friendly interface, dynamic
              visualization and advanced queries, we also believe MMiRNA-Viewer
              offers an intuitive approach for visualizing and elucidating
              co-relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs of both tumor and
              normal samples. We suggest that miRNA and mRNA pairs with
              opposite fold changes of their expression and with inverted
              correlation values between tumor and normal samples might be most
              relevant for explaining the decoupling of mRNAs and their
              targeting miRNAs in tumor samples for certain cancer types.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: microRNA (miRNA) is a short RNA (~ 22 nt) that
              regulates gene expression at the posttranscriptional level.
              Aberration of miRNA expressions could affect their targeting
              mRNAs involved in cancer-related signaling pathways. We conduct
              clustering analysis of miRNA and mRNA using expression data from
              the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We combine the Hungarian
              algorithm and blossom algorithm in graph theory. Data analysis is
              done using programming language R and Python. METHODS: We first
              quantify edge-weights of the miRNA-mRNA pairs by combining their
              expression correlation coefficient in tumor (T\_CC) and
              correlation coefficient in normal (N\_CC). We thereby introduce a
              bipartite graph partition procedure to identify cluster
              candidates. Specifically, we propose six weight formulas to
              quantify the change of miRNA-mRNA expression T\_CC relative to
              N\_CC, and apply the traditional hierarchical clustering to
              subjectively evaluate the different weight formulas of miRNA-mRNA
              pairs. Among these six different weight formulas, we choose the
              optimal one, which we define as the integrated mean value
              weights, to represent the connections between miRNA and mRNAs.
              Then the Hungarian algorithm and the blossom algorithm are
              employed on the miRNA-mRNA bipartite graph to passively determine
              the clusters. The combination of Hungarian and the blossom
              algorithms is dubbed maximum weighted merger method (MWMM).
              RESULTS: MWMM identifies clusters of different sizes that meet
              the mathematical criterion that internal connections inside a
              cluster are relatively denser than external connections outside
              the cluster and biological criterion that the intra-cluster Gene
              Ontology (GO) term similarities are larger than the inter-cluster
              GO term similarities. MWMM is developed using breast invasive
              carcinoma (BRCA) as training data set, but can also applies to
              other cancer type data sets. MWMM shows advantage in GO term
              similarity in most cancer types, when compared to other
              algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: miRNAs and mRNAs that are likely to be
              affected by common underlying causal factors in cancer can be
              clustered by MWMM approach and potentially be used as candidate
              biomarkers for different cancer types and provide clues for
              targets of precision medicine in cancer treatment.",

              methods: We applied a systems biology approach by combining
              differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression
              network analysis (WGCNA) to detect the pathological stage-related
              miRNA and gene modules and construct a miRNA-gene network. The
              Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) colon adenocarcinoma (CAC)
              RNA-sequencing data and miRNA-sequencing data were subjected to
              WGCNA analysis, and the GSE29623, GSE35602 and GSE39396 were
              utilized to validate and characterize the results of WGCNA.
              Results: Two gene modules (Gmagenta and Ggreen) and one miRNA
              module were associated with the pathological stage. Six hub genes
              (COL1A2, THBS2, BGN, COL1A1, TAGLN and DACT3) were related to
              prognosis and validated to be associated with the pathological

              Proteoglycans in cancer, focal adhesion, extracellular matrix

              women, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly
              aggressive subtype. Increasing evidence has shown that lncRNAs
              are involved in tumor growth, cell-cycle, and apoptosis through
              interactions with miRNAs or mRNAs. However, there is still
              limited data on ceRNAs involved in the molecular mechanisms
              underlying TNBC. In this study, we applied the weighted gene
              co-expression network analysis to the existing microarray mRNA
              and lncRNA expression data obtained from the breast tissues of
              TNBC patients to find the hub genes and lncRNAs involved in TNBC.
              Functional enrichment was performed on the module that correlated
              with Ki-67 status the most (Turquoise module). The hub genes in
              the Turquoise module were found to be associated with DNA repair,

              co-expression analysis of the protein-coding and lncRNA hub genes

              network, two mRNAs (RAD51AP1 and TYMS) were found to be

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: While microRNAs (miRNAs) were widely considered to
              repress target genes at mRNA and/or protein levels, emerging
              evidence from in vitro experiments has shown that miRNAs can also
              activate gene expression in particular contexts. However, this
              counterintuitive observation has rarely been reported or
              interpreted in in vivo conditions. METHODS: We systematically
              explored the positive correlation between miRNA and gene
              expressions and its potential implications in tumorigenesis,
              based on 8375 patient samples across 31 major human cancers from
              The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). FINDINGS: We found that positive
              miRNA-gene correlations are surprisingly prevalent and consistent
              across cancer types, and show distinct patterns than negative
              correlations. The top-ranked positive correlations are
              significantly involved in the immune cell differentiation and
              cell membrane signaling related processes, and display strong
              power in stratifying patients in terms of survival rate. Although
              intragenic miRNAs generally tend to co-express with their host
              genes, a substantial portion of miRNAs shows no obvious
              correlation with their host gene plausibly due to
              non-conservation. A miRNA can upregulate a gene by inhibiting its
              upstream suppressor, or shares transcription factors with that
              gene, both leading to positive correlation. The miRNA/gene sites
              associated with the top-ranked positive correlations are more
              likely to form super-enhancers compared to randomly chosen pairs.
              Wet-lab experiments revealed that positive correlations partially
              remain in in vitro condition. INTERPRETATION: Our study brings
              new insights into the critical role of miRNA in gene regulation
              and the complex mechanisms underlying miRNA functions, and

              Several studies suggest a negative impact of increased NLR for
              patient's survival in different types of cancer. However,
              previous findings from small-scale studies revealed conflicting
              results about its prognostic significance with regard to
              different clinical end points in non-metastatic renal cell
              carcinoma (RCC) patients. Therefore, the aim of our study was the
              validation of the prognostic significance of NLR in a large
              cohort of RCC patients. METHODS: Data from 678 consecutive
              non-metastatic clear cell RCC patients, operated between 2000 and
              2010 at a single centre, were evaluated retrospectively.
              Cancer-specific, metastasis-free, as well as overall survival
              (OS) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. To evaluate the
              independent prognostic significance of NLR, multivariate Cox
              regression models were applied for all three different end
              points. Influence of the NLR on the predictive accuracy of the
              Leibovich prognosis score was determined by Harrell's concordance
              index. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis identified increased NLR as
              an independent prognostic factor for overall (hazard ratio
              (HR)=1.59, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.10-2.31, P=0.014), but
              not for cancer-specific (HR=1.59, 95\% CI=0.84-2.99, P=0.148),

              P=0.184). The estimated concordance index was 0.79 using the
              Leibovich risk score and 0.81 when NLR was added. CONCLUSION:
              Regarding patients' OS, an increased NLR represented an
              independent risk factor, which might reflect a higher risk for
              severe cardiovascular and other comorbidities. Adding the NLR to
              well-established prognostic models such as the Leibovich

              combining phosphoproteomic and transcriptome analysis to dissect
              cellular signaling in MM to inform precision medicine strategies.
              Unbiased phosphoproteomics initially revealed differential
              activation of kinases across MM cell lines and that sensitivity

              enriched for NRAS Q61 mutations, have inferior outcomes, whereas
              RAS mutations overall carry no survival impact. We further
              developed an interactive software tool to relate pharmacologic
              and genetic kinase dependencies in myeloma. Collectively, these

              highlight surprising differences in functional signaling patterns
              between NRAS and KRAS mutants invisible to the genomic landscape.
              These results will lead to improved stratification of MM patients
              in precision medicine trials while also revealing unexplored

              factors regulating cell death, proliferation and division time.
              We used the cell viability-signature relationship to predict
              viability from transcriptomics signatures, and identified and
              validated compounds that induce cell death in tumor cell lines.

              distribution of miRNAs, we utilized a tissue specificity index

              i.e. were neither specific for single tissues (TSI > 0.85) nor
              housekeeping miRNAs (TSI < 0.5). Nonetheless, we observed many
              different miRNAs and miRNA families that were predominantly
              expressed in certain tissues. Clustering of miRNA abundances
              revealed that tissues like several areas of the brain clustered

              RNA-seq data is accumulating, and full utilization of publicly
              available miRNA data is an important challenge. These data are
              useful to determine expression values for each miRNA, but
              quantification pipelines are in a primitive stage and still
              evolving; there are many factors that affect expression values
              significantly. Results: We used 304 high-quality microRNA
              sequencing (miRNA-seq) datasets from NCBI-SRA and calculated
              expression profiles for different tissues and cell-lines. In each
              miRNA-seq dataset, we found an average of more than 500 miRNAs

              engendered rapid accumulation of expression data evolving from
              microarray experiments. Such experiments are generally performed
              over different tissues belonging to a specific species of

              frequently mapped to co-expression networks to study the

              introduces a novel method for mining the miRNA co-expression
              networks in order to obtain co-expressed miRNAs under the
              hypothesis that these might be regulated by common TFs. RESULTS:
              Three co-expression networks, configured from one
              patient-specific, one tissue-specific and a stem cell-based miRNA
              expression data, are studied for analyzing the proposed
              methodology. A novel compactness measure is introduced. The
              results establish the statistical significance of the sets of
              miRNAs evolved and the efficacy of the self-pruning phase
              employed by the proposed method. All these datasets yield similar
              network patterns and produce coherent groups of miRNAs. The
              existence of common TFs, regulating these groups of miRNAs, is
              empirically tested. The results found are very promising. A novel
              visual validation method is also proposed that reflects the
              homogeneity as well as statistical properties of the grouped
              miRNAs. This visual validation method provides a promising and
              statistically significant graphical tool for expression analysis.
              CONCLUSION: A heuristic mining methodology that resembles a
              clustering motivation is proposed in this paper. However, there
              remains a basic difference between the mining method and a
              clustering approach. The heuristic approach can produce priority
              modules (PM) from an miRNA co-expression network, by employing a
              self-pruning phase, which are analyzed for statistical and
              biological significance. The mining algorithm minimizes the
              space/time complexity of the analysis, and also handles noise in
              the data. In addition, the mining method reveals promising
              results in the unsupervised analysis of TF-miRNA regulation.",

              regulatory RNAs. Identifications of the dys-regulated or

              understanding the regulatory networks associated with the studied
              cellular processes. Several computational methods have been
              developed to infer the perturbed miRNA regulatory networks by
              integrating genome-wide gene expression data and sequence-based
              miRNA-target predictions. However, most of them only use the
              expression information of the miRNA direct targets, rarely
              considering the secondary effects of miRNA perturbation on the
              global gene regulatory networks. RESULTS: We proposed a network
              propagation based method to infer the perturbed miRNAs and their
              key target genes by integrating gene expressions and global gene
              regulatory network information. The method used random walk with
              restart in gene regulatory networks to model the network effects
              of the miRNA perturbation. Then, it evaluated the significance of
              the correlation between the network effects of the miRNA

              applied it on a gene expression dataset of colorectal cancer

              advantage of the network effect of the miRNA perturbation on its

  abstract = "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of endogenous small regulatory RNAs,
              play important roles in many biological and physiological
              processes. The perturbations of some miRNAs, which are usually
              called as onco-microRNAs (onco-miRs), are significantly
              associated with multiple stages of cancer. Although hundreds of
              miRNAs have been discovered, the perturbed miRNA regulatory
              networks and their functions are still poorly understood in
              cancer. Analyzing the expression patterns of miRNA target genes
              is a very useful strategy to infer the perturbed miRNA networks.
              However, due to the complexity of cancer transcriptome, current
              methods often encounter low sensitivity and report few onco-miR
              candidates. Here, we developed a new method, named miRHiC
              (enrichment analysis of miRNA targets in Hierarchical gene
              Co-expression signatures), to infer the perturbed miRNA
              regulatory networks by using the hierarchical co-expression
              signatures in large-scale cancer gene expression datasets. The
              method can infer onco-miR candidates and their target networks
              which are only linked to sub-clusters of the differentially
              expressed genes at fine scales of the co-expression hierarchy. On
              two real datasets of lung cancer and hepatocellular cancer,

              identified many new candidates (such as miR-149, which is
              inferred in both types of cancers). Using hierarchical gene
              co-expression signatures, miRHiC can greatly increase the

              appear to be contradictory to a larger extent and cannot be fully

              loops that are mainly considered by one-to-one regulatory
              interactions of the involved molecules. Here, we propose an
              extended model of the regulatory role of miRs that, at least,
              supplements the usually considered single/oligo-target regulation
              of certain miRs. The cellular availability of the participating
              miR members in this model reflects an upper hierarchy level of

              neighboring cells, soluble factors, hypoxia, chemotherapeutic

              the understanding of cellular functional complexes, such as for
              apoptosis, migration, and proliferation. These complexes consist
              of many regulatory components that can be targeted by miR cluster

              regulatory networks and fundamental sub-networks. An integrative
              computational resource generating a comprehensive view of these
              regulatory molecular interactions at a genome-wide scale would be
              of great interest to biologists, but is not available to date.
              RESULTS: To identify and analyze molecular interaction networks,
              we developed MIR@NT@N, an integrative approach based on a
              meta-regulation network model and a large-scale database.
              MIR@NT@N uses a graph-based approach to predict novel molecular
              actors across multiple regulatory processes (i.e. TFs acting on
              protein-coding or miRNA genes, or miRNAs acting on messenger
              RNAs). Exploiting these predictions, the user can generate
              networks and further analyze them to identify sub-networks,
              including motifs such as feedback and feedforward loops (FBL and
              FFL). In addition, networks can be built from lists of molecular
              actors with an a priori role in a given biological process to
              predict novel and unanticipated interactions. Analyses can be
              contextualized and filtered by integrating additional information
              such as microarray expression data. All results, including
              generated graphs, can be visualized, saved and exported into

              establish a high-performance computing platform to construct
              large-scale networks from comprehensive human and murine antibody
              repertoire sequencing datasets (>100,000 unique sequences).
              Leveraging a network-based statistical framework, we identify
              three fundamental principles of antibody repertoire architecture:
              reproducibility, robustness and redundancy. Antibody repertoire
              networks are highly reproducible across individuals despite high
              antibody sequence dissimilarity. The architecture of antibody
              repertoires is robust to the removal of up to 50-90\% of randomly
              selected clones, but fragile to the removal of public clones
              shared among individuals. Finally, repertoire architecture is
              intrinsically redundant. Our analysis provides guidelines for the
              large-scale network analysis of immune repertoires and may be
              used in the future to define disease-associated and synthetic
              repertoires.",

              Analysis of these information-rich data can be guided based on a

              Assessing the response of a specific mechanism and investigating
              its biological basis is extremely important in systems
              toxicology; as compounds or treatment need to be assessed with
              respect to a predefined set of key mechanisms that could lead to
              toxicity. Two-layer networks are suitable for this task, and a
              robust computational methodology specifically addressing those
              needs was previously published. The NPA package (

              topological changes in gene-regulator dependence networks
              inferred on the basis of mRNA expression datasets within distinct
              biological states. DISCERN takes two expression datasets as
              input: an expression dataset of diseased tissues from patients
              with a disease of interest and another expression dataset from
              matching normal tissues. DISCERN estimates the extent to which
              each gene is perturbed-having distinct regulator connectivity in
              the inferred gene-regulator dependencies between the disease and
              normal conditions. This approach has distinct advantages over
              existing methods. First, DISCERN infers conditional dependencies
              between candidate regulators and genes, where conditional
              dependence relationships discriminate the evidence for direct
              interactions from indirect interactions more precisely than

              scoring function to alleviate concerns about accuracy of the
              specific edges inferred in a particular network. DISCERN
              identifies perturbed genes more accurately in synthetic data than

              DISCERN can uncover potential mechanisms underlying network

              biology is to simulate regulatory mechanisms using dynamic
              models. Among others, Boolean networks can be used to model the
              dynamics of regulatory processes in biology. Boolean network
              models allow simulating the qualitative behavior of the modeled
              processes. A central objective in the simulation of Boolean
              networks is the computation of their long-term behavior-so-called
              attractors. These attractors are of special interest as they can
              often be linked to biologically relevant behaviors. Changing
              internal and external conditions can influence the long-term
              behavior of the Boolean network model. Perturbation of a Boolean
              network by stripping a component of the system or simulating a
              surplus of another element can lead to different attractors.
              Apparently, the number of possible perturbations and combinations

              associated with autoimmunity, but the molecular basis for this
              phenomenon is undefined. We examined the T cell response to an
              HLA-B*3501-restricted epitope (HPVGEADYFEY) from Epstein-Barr
              virus (EBV), which is frequently dominated by a TRBV9*01(+)

              which differs by a single amino acid near the CDR2beta loop
              (Gln55-->His55), was never used in this response. The structure
              of the TK3 TCR, its allelic variant, and a nonnaturally occurring
              mutant (Gln55-->Ala55) in complex with HLA-B*3501(HPVGEADYFEY)

              reduced functional recognition of the cognate and naturally

              prerequisite for TCR gene therapy is sufficient expression of
              transferred TCRs. Several strategies to achieve optimal
              expression were developed, including ``murinization,'' which
              replaces the human TCRalpha and TCRbeta constant regions by their
              murine counterparts. Using a series of mouse-human hybrid
              constructs, we have identified nine amino acids responsible for
              the improved expression of murinized TCRs. Five essential amino
              acid exchanges were identified in the TCRbeta C region, with
              exchange of a glutamic acid (human) for a basic lysine (mouse) at
              position 18 of the C region, being most important. For the
              TCRalpha C region, an area of four amino acids was sufficient for
              improved expression. The minimally murinized TCR variants
              (harboring only nine residues of the mouse sequence) enhanced
              expression of human TCRs by supporting preferential pairing of
              transferred TCR chains and a more stable association with the CD3
              proteins. Most important, usage of minimally murinized TCR chains
              improved the function of transduced primary human T cells in
              comparison with cells transduced with wild-type TCRs. For TCR

              indicated that this interaction was enhanced by and was dependent
              on CD5 tyrosine phosphorylation. However, there was no difference

              steady state. Errors in velocity estimates arise if the central
              assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the
              full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are
              violated. With scVelo (https://scvelo.org), we address these

              splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This
              generalizes RNA velocity to a wide variety of systems comprising

              included from the first clinical trial and 146 were included from

              tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD8 TIL) can be classified
              into two main groups: `exhausted' TILs, characterized by high
              expression of the inhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIM-3 and lack of
              transcription factor 1 (Tcf1); and `memory-like' TILs, with
              self-renewal capacity and co-expressing Tcf1 and PD-1. However, a
              comprehensive definition of the heterogeneity existing within
              both tumor-specific and total CD8 TILs has yet to be clearly
              established. To investigate this heterogeneity at the
              transcriptomic level, we performed paired single-cell RNA and TCR
              sequencing of CD8 T cells infiltrating B16 murine melanoma
              tumors, including cells of known tumor specificity. Unsupervised
              clustering and gene signature analysis revealed four distinct CD8
              TIL states - exhausted, memory-like, naive and effector
              memory-like (EM-like) - and predicted novel markers, including
              Ly6C for the EM-like cells, that were validated by flow
              cytometry. Tumor-specific PMEL T cells were predominantly found
              within the exhausted and memory-like states but also within the
              EM-like state. Further, TCR repertoire sequencing revealed a
              large clonal expansion of exhausted, memory-like and EM-like
              cells with partial clonal relatedness between them. Finally,
              meta-analyses of public bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data
              suggested that anti-PD-1 treatment induces expansion of EM-like
              cells. Our reference map of the transcriptomic landscape of
              murine CD8 TILs will help interpreting future bulk and
              single-cell transcriptomic studies and may guide the analysis of
              CD8 TIL subpopulations in response to therapeutic interventions.",

  abstract = "'T cell exhaustion' is a broad term that has been used to
              describe the response of T cells to chronic antigen stimulation,
              first in the setting of chronic viral infection but more recently
              in response to tumours. Understanding the features of and
              pathways to exhaustion has crucial implications for the success
              of checkpoint blockade and adoptive T cell transfer therapies. In
              this Viewpoint article, 18 experts in the field tell us what
              exhaustion means to them, ranging from complete lack of effector
              function to altered functionality to prevent immunopathology,
              with potential differences between cancer and chronic infection.
              Their responses highlight the dichotomy between terminally
              differentiated exhausted T cells that are TCF1- and the
              self-renewing TCF1+ population from which they derive. These
              TCF1+ cells are considered by some to have stem cell-like
              properties akin to memory T cell populations, but the
              developmental relationships are unclear at present. Recent
              studies have also highlighted an important role for the
              transcriptional regulator TOX in driving the epigenetic
              enforcement of exhaustion, but key questions remain about the
              potential to reverse the epigenetic programme of exhaustion and
              how this might affect the persistence of T cell populations.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Analysis of gene expression data using genome-wide
              microarrays is a technique often used in genomic studies to find
              coexpression patterns and locate groups of co-transcribed genes.
              However, most studies done at global ``omic'' scale are not
              focused on human samples and when they correspond to human very
              often include heterogeneous datasets, mixing normal with
              disease-altered samples. Moreover, the technical noise present in
              genome-wide expression microarrays is another well reported
              problem that many times is not addressed with robust statistical
              methods, and the estimation of errors in the data is not
              provided. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Human genome-wide
              expression data from a controlled set of normal-healthy tissues
              is used to build a confident human gene coexpression network
              avoiding both pathological and technical noise. To achieve this
              we describe a new method that combines several statistical and
              computational strategies: robust normalization and expression
              signal calculation; correlation coefficients obtained by
              parametric and non-parametric methods; random cross-validations;
              and estimation of the statistical accuracy and coverage of the
              data. All these methods provide a series of coexpression datasets
              where the level of error is measured and can be tuned. To define
              the errors, the rates of true positives are calculated by
              assignment to biological pathways. The results provide a
              confident human gene coexpression network that includes 3327
              gene-nodes and 15841 coexpression-links and a comparative
              analysis shows good improvement over previously published
              datasets. Further functional analysis of a subset core network,
              validated by two independent methods, shows coherent biological
              modules that share common transcription factors. The network
              reveals a map of coexpression clusters organized in well defined
              functional constellations. Two major regions in this network
              correspond to genes involved in nuclear and mitochondrial
              metabolism and investigations on their functional assignment
              indicate that more than 60\% are house-keeping and essential
              genes. The network displays new non-described gene associations
              and it allows the placement in a functional context of some
              unknown non-assigned genes based on their interactions with known
              gene families. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The identification of
              stable and reliable human gene to gene coexpression networks is
              essential to unravel the interactions and functional correlations
              between human genes at an omic scale. This work contributes to
              this aim, and we are making available for the scientific
              community the validated human gene coexpression networks

              is well-known that the even unperturbed TCR repertoire structure

              individual patient characteristics are important tools for
              managing patient care. Electronic health data (EHD) are appealing
              sources of training data because they provide access to large
              amounts of rich individual-level data from present-day patient
              populations. However, because EHD are derived by extracting
              information from administrative and clinical databases, some
              fraction of subjects will not be under observation for the entire
              time frame over which one wants to make predictions; this loss to
              follow-up is often due to disenrollment from the health system.
              For subjects without complete follow-up, whether or not they
              experienced the adverse event is unknown, and in statistical
              terms the event time is said to be right-censored. Most machine
              learning approaches to the problem have been relatively ad hoc;
              for example, common approaches for handling observations in which
              the event status is unknown include (1) discarding those
              observations, (2) treating them as non-events, (3) splitting

              outcomes using inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW).

              show relatively few deaths from extrinsic causes such as
              predation and starvation. Theoretical explorations and empirical
              tests of Williams's hypothesis have flourished in the past decade

              Williams's hypothesis using mortality data from subsistence
              populations and from historical cohorts from Sweden and
              England/Wales, and examine whether rates of actuarial aging

              clinical testing. By combining the properties of nanobeads with
              optical disc technology, we have developed a novel device named
              the ExoCounter to determine the exact number of exosomes in the
              sera of patients with various types of cancer. METHOD: In this
              system, individual exosomes were captured in the groove of an
              optical disc coated with antibodies against exosome surface
              antigens. The captured exosomes were labeled with
              antibody-conjugated magnetic nanobeads, and the number of the
              labeled exosomes was counted with an optical disc drive. RESULTS:
              We showed that the ExoCounter could detect specific exosomes
              derived from cells or human serum without any enrichment
              procedures. The detection sensitivity and linearity with this

              the age-dependent acceleration of mortality, inversely related to
              the morality rate doubling time. In contrast factors that
              influence only initial mortality rate are thought to be less
              relevant to the fundamental processes of aging. To resolve these
              two determinants of mortality rate and lifespan, initial morality
              rate and rate of senescence are calculated using the Gompertz
              equation. Despite theoretical and empirical evidence that the
              Gompertz parameters are most consistently and reliably estimated
              by maximum-likelihood techniques, and somewhat less so by
              non-linear regression, many researchers continue to use linear
              regression on the log-transformed hazard rate. The present study
              compares these three methods in the analysis of several published

              used to compare the theoretical values to the actual values of

              preimplantation embryo development, but extrapolation of these
              results to humans is questionable. Therefore, we wanted to
              analyse the global expression profiles during early mouse and
              human development with a special focus on genes involved in the
              regulation of the apoptotic and survival pathways. We used DNA

              profiles of preimplantation human and mouse embryos (metaphase II
              oocytes, embryos at the embryonic genome activation stage, and
              blastocysts). Components of the major apoptotic and survival
              signalling pathways were expressed during early human and mouse
              embryonic development; however, most expression profiles were
              species-specific. Particularly, the expression of genes encoding
              components and regulators of the apoptotic machinery were
              extremely stable in mouse embryos at all analysed stages, while
              it was more stage-specific in human embryos. CASP3, CASP9, and
              AIF were the only apoptosis-related genes expressed in both

              However, it is unclear how caspase-2 mediates these differential

              transcriptomic changes caused by caspase-2 (Casp2-/-) deficiency
              in tumors from E$\mu$Myc and Th-MYCN mice. We describe key

              and gradual atrophy and selective neuronal loss in the striatum
              and cerebral cortex are the pathologic hallmarks. HD is caused by
              expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats at the N-terminus of IT15 that
              encodes the huntingtin (HTT) protein, though the molecular
              mechanisms through which the mutant HTT (mHTT) exerts toxic
              effects remain obscure. Members of the caspase family, including
              caspase-2 (Casp2), play an important role in HD pathogenesis.
              Genetic ablation of Casp2 ameliorates cognitive and motor
              deficits of HD mice, though the molecular targets of Casp2 are
              still unclear. It is well established that the

  abstract = "Lewy body diseases are neurodegenerative disorders characterized
              by Lewy bodies in the brain. Lewy body dementia (LBD) refers to
              two forms of Lewy body disease: Parkinson's disease with dementia
              (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Tau is a cytoskeletal
              protein found in neurofibrillary tangles, but not Lewy bodies.
              The gene encoding tau, MAPT, is a well-established genetic risk
              factor for LBD; odds ratios of the H1:H2 MAPT haplotypes have
              been reported in the range of 2 to 4. Despite this genetic
              association, the mechanism by which tau contributes to dementia
              is unclear. Recently, a soluble form of tau, $\Delta$tau314,
              which is generated when caspase-2 (Casp2) cleaves tau at Asp314,
              was reported to be associated with impaired cognition in mice
              modeling frontotemporal dementia, and with mild cognitive
              impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans. To investigate
              whether $\Delta$tau314 is associated with dementia in Lewy body
              disease, we compared $\Delta$tau314 levels in aqueous extracts
              from the superior temporal gyrus of pathologically confirmed LBD
              (n = 21) and non-dementia Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 12). We
              excluded subjects with AD or microvascular pathology, which could
              mask potential associations of $\Delta$tau314 with LBD.Using a
              $\Delta$tau314-specific ELISA, we found ~ 2-fold higher levels of
              $\Delta$tau314 in LBD relative to PD (p = 0.009). Additionally,
              we found ~40\% lower levels of soluble total tau and the neuronal
              marker $\beta$-III-tubulin in LBD. These results suggest that in
              LBD, there is substantial neuron loss or axonal degeneration in
              the neocortex but disproportionately high levels of
              $\Delta$tau314 in the surviving neurons.Our results indicate an
              association between $\Delta$tau314 and dementia in Lewy body
              disease. Cleavage of tau by Casp2 promotes the mislocalization of
              tau to dendritic spines leading to a reduction in postsynaptic
              AMPA receptors and excitatory neurotransmission, which suggests a
              mechanism of the synaptic dysfunction underlying cognitive
              impairment in LBD. These findings support the potential of Casp2
              as a novel drug target for treating LBD.",

              small, secreted proteins that signal through cell surface G
              protein-coupled heptahelical chemokine receptors. They are best
              known for their ability to stimulate the migration of cells, most
              notably white blood cells (leukocytes). Consequently, chemokines
              play a central role in the development and homeostasis of the
              immune system, and are involved in all protective or destructive
              immune and inflammatory responses. Classically viewed as inducers
              of directed chemotactic migration, it is now clear that
              chemokines can stimulate a variety of other types of directed and
              undirected migratory behavior, such as haptotaxis, chemokinesis,
              and haptokinesis, in addition to inducing cell arrest or
              adhesion. However, chemokine receptors on leukocytes can do more
              than just direct migration, and these molecules can also be
              expressed on, and regulate the biology of, many nonleukocytic
              cell types. Chemokines are profoundly affected by
              post-translational modification, by interaction with the
              extracellular matrix (ECM), and by binding to heptahelical
              'atypical' chemokine receptors that regulate chemokine

              And importantly, where is there room for progress? In this work,
              we explore the answers to these two questions by performing an

              performance across a range of alignment parameters using common

              technical metrics such as fraction mapping or expression profile

              have any role in biological discovery. Surprisingly, we find that

              have demonstrated the potential of supervised computational

              require a priori information on the marker genes or composition

              absence of validated marker genes for many (including novel)
              subpopulations, we describe convex analysis of mixtures (CAM), a
              fully unsupervised in silico method, for identifying
              subpopulation marker genes directly from the original mixed gene
              expressions in scatter space that can improve molecular analyses

              CAM on the gene expression data from peripheral leukocytes, brain

              were otherwise undetectable using existing methods. Importantly,
              CAM requires no a priori information on the number, identity, or
              composition of the subpopulations present in mixed samples, and
              does not require the presence of pure subpopulations in sample

              describe the first tranche of large-scale exome sequence data for
              49,960 study participants, revealing approximately 4 million
              coding variants (of which ~98.4\% have frequency 10-fold increase
              compared to imputed sequence for the same participants. Nearly
              all genes (>97\%) had $\geq$1 predicted loss of function carrier,
              and most genes (>69\%) had $\geq$10 loss of function carriers. We
              illustrate the power of characterizing loss of function variation
              in this large population through association analyses across
              1,741 phenotypes. In addition to replicating a range of
              established associations, we discover novel loss of function
              variants with large effects on disease traits, including PIEZO1

              this population, finding that 2\% of the population has a

              Atlas (TCGA) RNA and DNA sequence data. Category 1 had truly
              integrated HPV16 genomes, category 2 had simple episomal genomes,
              and category 3 had novel episomes that were a hybrid between
              viral and human DNA. Using our categorization, we investigated in
              this study survival of patients with integrated HPV16 tumors
              versus patients with episomal HPV16 tumors. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: The TCGA RNA-Seq sequence reads were used to quantify
              HPV E2 and E7 gene expression, which was used as a marker for HPV
              integration. RESULTS: The results demonstrate that integration is
              associated with poor survival; those patients with integrated HPV
              tumors fared no better than non-HPV tumors in their five-year
              survival. Integrated HPV in tumors was found strikingly to be
              prevalent in patients born earlier while episomal HPV was
              prevalent in patients born later. We also observed a fairly
              constant incidence of all HPV forms among head and neck cancer
              patients over the last eight years of this study (2006-2013).
              CONCLUSION: We propose our characterization of HPV integrated and
              episomal state is more accurate than previous studies that may
              have mischaracterized the hybrid HPV-human DNA episomes as
              integrated. The state of integrated HPV is associated with a poor

              integrated HPV among all HPV forms peaked and is decreasing. We

              papillomavirus (HPV)-associated head and neck cancer (HNC) tumors
              that predispose them to different outcomes; however, the
              molecular heterogeneity in this subgroup is poorly characterized
              due to various historical reasons. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We
              performed unsupervised gene expression clustering on deeply
              annotated (transcriptome and genome) HPV(+) HNC samples from two
              cohorts (84 total primary tumors), including 18 HPV(-) HNC
              samples, to discover subtypes and characterize the differences
              between subgroups in terms of their HPV characteristics, pathway
              activity, whole-genome somatic copy number alterations, and
              mutation frequencies. RESULTS: We identified two distinct HPV(+)
              subtypes (namely HPV-KRT and HPV-IMU). HPV-KRT is characterized
              by elevated expression of genes in keratinocyte differentiation
              and oxidation-reduction process, whereas HPV-IMU has strong
              immune response and mesenchymal differentiation. The differences
              in expression are likely connected to the differences in HPV
              characteristics and genomic changes. HPV-KRT has more genic viral
              integration, lower E2/E4/E5 expression levels, and higher ratio
              of spliced to full-length HPV oncogene E6 than HPV-IMU; the
              subgroups also show differences in copy number alterations and
              mutations, in particular the loss of chr16q in HPV-IMU and gain
              of chr3q and PIK3CA mutation in HPV-KRT. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              characterization of two subtypes of HPV(+) HNC tumors provides
              valuable molecular level information that point to two main
              carcinogenic paths. Together, these results shed light on

              personalized care for HPV(+) HNC patients. Clin Cancer Res;

              the centrosome and its causal relation to human cancer
              development - a postulate that has existed for almost a century.
              Centrosome amplification (CA) is frequently detected in a growing
              list of human cancers, both solid and haematological, and is a
              candidate ``hallmark'' of cancer cells. Several lines of evidence
              support the progressive involvement of CA in the transition from
              early to advanced stages of carcinogenesis, being also found in
              pre-neoplastic lesions and even in histopathologically-normal
              tissue. CA constitutes the major mechanism leading to chromosomal
              instability and aneuploidy, via the formation of multipolar
              spindles and chromosomal missegregation. Clinically, CA may
              translate to a greater risk for initiation of malignant
              transformation, tumour progression, chemoresistance and
              ultimately, poor patient prognosis. As mechanisms underlying CA
              are progressively being unravelled, the centrosome has emerged as
              a novel candidate target for cancer treatment. This Review
              summarizes mainly the clinical studies performed to date focusing
              on the mechanisms underlying CA in human neoplasia, and

              DENV-specific CD8+ T cell subsets have not been defined. Here, we

              features (i.e., misclassification) at radical prostatectomy (RP).
              PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 16 049 patients with low- or
              intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with RP were
              identified. Misclassification was defined as non-organ confined
              or grade group $\geq$3 disease at RP. The coefficients of a
              logistic regression model predicting misclassification were used
              to develop a risk score. We then performed a systematic analysis
              of different thresholds to discriminate between patients with or
              without unfavourable disease and we compared it to available AS
              criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 5289 (33.0\%) patients had
              unfavourable disease. At multivariable analyses, PSA level,
              clinical stage, biopsy grade group, the number of positive cores,
              and PSA density were associated with the risk of unfavourable
              disease (all P < 0.001). The Prostate Cancer Research
              International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) criteria were
              associated with a lower risk of misclassification (13\%) compared
              to other criteria. Overall, 3303 (20.6\%) patients were eligible
              according to the PRIAS protocol. The adoption of an 18\%
              threshold according to the risk score increased the proportion of
              eligible patients from 20.6\% to 29.4\% without increasing the

              model represents the first instance of de novo
              papillomavirus-mediated carcinogenesis in the female reproductive
              tract of wild-type mice resulting from active virus infection and
              is also the first report of the female hormone estrogen
              contributing to this process. This model will provide an
              additional platform for fundamental studies on papillomavirus
              infection, cervicovaginal disease, and the role of cellular
              cofactors during papillomavirus-induced carcinogenesis.IMPORTANCE
              Tractable and efficient models of papillomavirus-induced
              pathogenesis are limited due to the strict species-specific and
              tissue-specific tropism of these viruses. Here, we report a novel
              preclinical murine model of papillomavirus-induced cervicovaginal
              disease in wild-type, immunocompetent mice using the recently
              discovered murine papillomavirus, MmuPV1. In this model, MmuPV1
              establishes persistent viral infections in the mucosal epithelia
              of the female reproductive tract, a necessary component needed to
              accurately mimic HPV-mediated neoplastic disease in humans.
              Persistent MmuPV1 infections were able to induce progressive
              neoplastic disease and carcinogenesis, either alone or in
              combination with previously identified cofactors of
              papillomavirus-induced disease. This new model will provide a
              much-needed platform for basic and translational studies on both
              papillomavirus infection and associated disease in
              immunocompetent mice.",

              malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths
              among men in the United States. High-throughput genotyping has
              enabled discovery of germline genetic susceptibility variants
              (herein referred to as germline mutations) associated with an
              increased risk of developing PCa. However, germline mutation
              information has not been leveraged and integrated with
              information on acquired somatic mutations to link genetic
              susceptibility to tumorigenesis. The objective of this
              exploratory study was to address this knowledge gap. METHODS:
              Germline mutations and associated gene information were derived
              from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reports. Somatic
              mutation and gene expression data were derived from 495 tumors
              and 52 normal control samples obtained from The Cancer Genome
              Atlas (TCGA). We integrated germline and somatic mutation
              information using gene expression data. We performed enrichment
              analysis to discover molecular networks and biological pathways
              enriched for germline and somatic mutations. RESULTS: We
              discovered a signature of 124 genes containing both germline and
              somatic mutations. Enrichment analysis revealed molecular
              networks and biological pathways enriched for germline and

              the first to examine the miRNA profiles of EBV reactivation and
              to use a correction step with seronegative patients as a
              reference. Between 2012 and 2017, we examined the expression
              profiles of 11 selected EBV miRNAs in 129 whole blood samples
              from primary infection, reactivation, healthy carriers and EBV
              seronegative patients. Three of the miRNAs could not be detected
              in any sample. Other miRNAs showed significantly higher
              expression levels and prevalence during primary infection than in
              other stages; miR-BHRF1-1 was the most abundant. The expression
              profiles from reactivation differed slightly but not
              significantly from those of healthy carriers, but a specific
              marker miRNA for each stage could not be identified within the
              selected EBV miRNA targets.",

              Increasing evidence indicates that EBV miRNAs target the host

              HPV16/18/31/33/35/45/51/59/66/70 E6E7) in two or three HFK donors
              each were studied.All hrHPV-transduced HFKs showed an increased

              hTERT locus at 5p was exclusively gained in cells with a history
              of crisis and coincided with increased expression. Chromothripsis
              was detected in one cell line in which multiple rearrangements
              within chromosome 8 resulted in a gain of MYC.Together we

              reduced immortalization capacity in vitro, reflected by a crisis
              period, require more genetic host cell aberrations to facilitate
              immortalization than types that can immortalize without crisis.
              This may in part explain the observed differences in HPV-type
              prevalence in cervical cancers and emphasizes that changes in the

              carcinogenic progression is genomic instability, which is
              frequently associated with cell division errors and aneuploidy.
              The HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein has been previously shown to rapidly
              induce centriole and centrosome overduplication and to cooperate
              with HPV-16 E6 in the induction of abnormal multipolar mitoses.
              Based on this function, it has been suggested that HPV-16 E7 may
              act as a driving force for chromosomal instability. However, a
              detailed analysis of centrosome overduplication in primary
              HPV-associated neoplasms has not been performed so far. Here, we
              determined the frequency of centrosome overduplication in
              HPV-associated anal lesions using a recently identified marker
              for mature maternal centrioles, Cep170. We detected centrosome
              overduplication in a small but significant fraction of cells.
              Remarkably, centrosome overduplication, but not aberrant
              centrosome numbers per se or centrosome accumulation, correlated
              significantly with the presence of cell division errors. In
              addition, our experiments revealed that in particular
              pseudo-bipolar mitoses may play a role in the propagation of
              chromosomal instability in high-risk HPV-associated tumors. These

              Based on epidemiological data, a subgroup of
              alphapapillomaviruses (alpha HPVs) was referred to as high-risk
              (HR) HPV types. HR HPVs are the etiological agents of anogenital
              cancer and a subset of head and neck cancers. The cutaneous HPV
              types, mainly from beta and gamma genera, are widely present on
              the surface of the skin in the general population. However, there
              is growing evidence of an etiological role of
              betapapillomaviruses (beta HPVs) in non-melanoma skin cancer
              (NMSC), together with ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Studies
              performed on mucosal HR HPV types, such as 16 and 18, showed that
              both oncoproteins E6 and E7 play a key role in cervical cancer by
              altering pathways involved in the host immune response to
              establish a persistent infection and by promoting cellular
              transformation. Continuous expression of E6 and E7 of mucosal HR
              HPV types is essential to initiate and to maintain the cellular
              transformation process, whereas expression of E6 and E7 of
              cutaneous HPV types is not required for the maintenance of the

  abstract = "Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are DNA viruses associated with
              major human cancers. As such there is a strong interest in
              developing new means, such as vaccines and microbicides, to
              prevent HPV infections. Developing the latter requires a better
              understanding of the infectious life cycle of HPVs. The HPV
              infectious life cycle is closely linked to the differentiation
              state of the stratified epithelium it infects, with progeny virus
              only made in the terminally differentiating suprabasal
              compartment. It has long been recognized that HPV must first
              establish its infection within the basal layer of stratified
              epithelium, but why this is the case has not been understood. In
              part this restriction might reflect specificity of expression of
              entry receptors. However, this hypothesis could not fully explain
              the differentiation restriction of HPV infection, since many cell
              types can be infected with HPVs in monolayer cell culture. Here,
              we used chemical biology approaches to reveal that cell cycle
              progression through mitosis is critical for HPV infection. Using
              infectious HPV16 particles containing the intact viral genome,
              G1-synchronized human keratinocytes as hosts, and early viral
              gene expression as a readout for infection, we learned that the
              recipient cell must enter M phase (mitosis) for HPV infection to
              take place. Late M phase inhibitors had no effect on infection,
              whereas G1, S, G2, and early M phase cell cycle inhibitors
              efficiently prevented infection. We conclude that host cells need
              to pass through early prophase for successful onset of
              transcription of the HPV encapsidated genes. These findings
              provide one reason why HPVs initially establish infections in the
              basal compartment of stratified epithelia. Only this compartment
              of the epithelium contains cells progressing through the cell
              cycle, and therefore it is only in these cells that HPVs can
              establish their infection. By defining a major condition for cell
              susceptibility to HPV infection, these results also have
              potentially important implications for HPV control.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The importance of caspase-2 activation for mediating
              apoptosis in cancer is not clear and seems to differ between
              different tumour types. Furthermore, only few data have been
              obtained concerning the expression of caspase-2, which can be
              alternatively spliced into caspase-2L and caspase-2S, and the
              other PIDDosome members PIDD and RAIDD in human tumours in vivo.
              We, therefore, investigated their expression in renal cell
              carcinomas (RCCs) of the clear cell type in vivo and analysed the
              role of caspase-2 in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in RCCs in
              vitro. METHODS: The analyses were performed by semiquantitative
              real-time PCR, Western Blot and Caspase-2 Assay. RESULTS: Our in
              vivo results showed an overall decrease in proapoptotic
              caspase-2L expression during tumour progression due to an
              increase in the relative share of caspase-2S mRNA in total
              caspase-2 mRNA expression. Furthermore, an increase in the
              expression of PIDD and RAIDD could be observed. In contrast,
              antiapoptotic BCL-2 expression increased only during early tumour
              stages, whereas expression decreased in pT3 RCCs. In vitro,
              caspase-2 activation in RCC cell lines coincidenced with
              sensitivity of tumour cells towards Topotecan-induced apoptosis.
              However, inhibition of caspase-2 could not prevent
              Topotecan-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, Topotecan-resistance
              could be overcome by the apoptosis-sensitizing drug HA14-1.
              CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the concept of a shift towards a
              more antiapoptotic transcriptional context during tumour
              progression in RCCs. Furthermore, it shows that caspase-2
              participates in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in RCCs although
              it is not mandatory for it. Additionally, inhibition of
              antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members might provide a possible way

              hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC), which remain
              unknown. AIM2 and p‑STAT3 were detected using
              immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 111 parafﬁn‑embedded tissue samples
              from primary HSCC sites and 20 samples from matched adjacent
              non‑malignant sites. Western blotting was utilized to investigate
              AIM2, p‑STAT3 and total STAT3 in 5 pairs of fresh tissue samples.
              Western blotting indicated that AIM2 expression was significantly
              lower (P<0.05), but that p‑STAT3 levels and the p‑STAT3/STAT3
              ratio were higher (P<0.01) in HSCC tissues than in adjacent
              normal hypopharyngeal tissues. IHC analysis of the 111 HSCC
              samples revealed low AIM2 and high p‑STAT3 expression in 48
              (43.2\%) and 58 (52.3\%) samples, respectively. High AIM2
              expression and low p‑STAT3 expression were detected in 13 (75\%)
              and 18 (90\%) adjacent normal hypopharyngeal tissue samples,
              respectively. In the HSCC samples, low AIM2 expression was
              closely related to lymph node metastasis and intravascular tumor
              thrombus (P<0.05). Kaplan‑Meier survival curves revealed that low
              AIM2 levels were strongly associated with poor survival for HSCC
              patients (P<0.0001). Additionally, Cox proportional hazards
              regression models indicated that low AIM2 expression
              significantly predicted poor prognosis for HSCC patients
              (P<0.0001), and multivariate analysis revealed that AIM2
              expression could be an independent prognostic factor for HSCC
              patients (P<0.0001). Furthermore, AIM2 expression was negatively
              correlated with p‑STAT3 expression in the HSCC tissue samples,
              and combined analysis revealed that patients with low AIM2 and
              high p‑STAT3 levels had the worst survival rate. Moreover,
              receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed
              that AIM2 was predictive of specific survival in all HSCC
              patients [area under the curve (AUC)=0.7160]. In conclusion, our
              data suggested that for HSCC patients, AIM2 and p‑STAT3
              expression detected via IHC could serve as a biomarker to predict
              tumor progression and as an independent prognostic factor.",

              majority of adults but causes lymphoid and epithelial
              malignancies in a small fraction of latently infected
              individuals. Innate immunity is the first-line antiviral defense,
              which EBV has to evade in favor of its own replication and
              infection. EBV uses multiple strategies to perturb innate immune
              signaling pathways activated by Toll-like, RIG-I-like, NOD-like,
              and AIM2-like receptors as well as cyclic GMP-AMP synthase. EBV
              also counteracts interferon production and signaling, including
              TBK1-IRF3 and JAK-STAT pathways. However, activation of innate
              immunity also triggers pro-inflammatory response and proteolytic
              cleavage of caspases, both of which exhibit proviral activity
              under some circumstances. Pathogenic inflammation also
              contributes to EBV oncogenesis. EBV activates NF$\kappa$B
              signaling and induces pro-inflammatory cytokines. Through
              differential modulation of the proviral and antiviral roles of
              caspases and other host factors at different stages of infection,
              EBV usurps cellular programs for death and inflammation to its
              own benefits. The outcome of EBV infection is governed by a
              delicate interplay between innate immunity and EBV. A better

              Loss-of-function mutations of TREX1 are linked to
              Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS) and systemic lupus erythematosus
              (SLE) in humans. Trex1(-/-) mice exhibit autoimmune and
              inflammatory phenotypes that are associated with elevated
              expression of interferon (IFN)-induced genes (ISGs). Cyclic
              GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that
              activates the IFN pathway. Upon binding to DNA, cGAS is activated
              to catalyze the synthesis of cGAMP, which functions as a second
              messenger that binds and activates the adaptor protein STING to

              systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis, the mechanisms
              of IFN-I production have not been fully elucidated. Recognition
              of nucleic acids by DNA sensors induces IFN-I and

              guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator
              of interferon genes (STING) in SLE remains unclear. We studied
              the role of the cGAS-STING pathway in the IFN-I-producing cascade
              driven by SLE serum. METHODS: We collected sera from patients
              with SLE (n=64), patients with other autoimmune diseases (n=31)
              and healthy controls (n=35), and assayed them using a cell-based
              reporter system that enables highly sensitive detection of IFN-I
              and ISG-inducing activity. We used Toll-like receptor-specific
              reporter cells and reporter cells harbouring knockouts of cGAS,
              STING and IFNAR2 to evaluate signalling pathway-dependent ISG
              induction. RESULTS: IFN-I bioactivity and ISG-inducing activities
              of serum were higher in patients with SLE than in patients with
              other autoimmune diseases or healthy controls. ISG-inducing
              activity of SLE sera was significantly reduced in STING-knockout
              reporter cells, and STING-dependent ISG-inducing activity
              correlated with disease activity. Double-stranded DNA levels were
              elevated in SLE. Apoptosis-derived membrane vesicles (AdMVs) from
              SLE sera had high ISG-inducing activity, which was diminished in
              cGAS-knockout or STING-knockout reporter cells. CONCLUSIONS:
              AdMVs in SLE serum induce IFN-I production through activation of
              the cGAS-STING pathway. Thus, blockade of the cGAS-STING axis
              represents a promising therapeutic target for SLE. Moreover, our
              cell-based reporter system may be useful for stratifying patients

              Western blotting indicated that AIM2 expression was significantly

              recognizes various types of pathogen-associated molecular
              patterns (PAMPs), such as nucleic acids, via a series of
              membrane-bound or cytosolic pattern-recognition receptors. These
              include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs),
              AIM2-like receptors (ALRs), and cytosolic DNA sensors. The
              binding of PAMPs to these receptors triggers the production of
              type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines. Type I IFN
              induces the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs),
              which protect surrounding cells from infection. Some ISGs are
              nucleic acids-binding proteins that bind viral nucleic acids and
              suppress their replication. As nucleic acids are essential
              components that store and transmit genetic information in every
              species, infectious pathogens have developed systems to escape
              from the host nucleic acid recognition system. Host cells also

  abstract = "Background: Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) is a
              chronic childhood arthropathy with features of autoinflammation.
              Early inflammatory SJIA is associated with expansion and
              activation of neutrophils with a sepsis-like phenotype, but
              neutrophil phenotypes present in longstanding and clinically
              inactive disease (CID) are unknown. The objective of this study
              was to examine activated neutrophil subsets, S100 alarmin
              release, and gene expression signatures in children with a
              spectrum of SJIA disease activity. Methods: Highly-purified
              neutrophils were isolated using a two-step procedure of
              density-gradient centrifugation followed by magnetic-bead based
              negative selection prior to flow cytometry or cell culture to
              quantify S100 protein release. Whole transcriptome gene
              expression profiles were compared in neutrophils from children
              with both active SJIA and CID. Results: Patients with SJIA and
              active systemic features demonstrated a higher proportion of
              CD16+CD62Llo neutrophil population compared to controls. This
              neutrophil subset was not seen in patients with CID or patients
              with active arthritis not exhibiting systemic features. Using
              imaging flow cytometry, CD16+CD62Llo neutrophils from patients
              with active SJIA and features of macrophage activation syndrome
              (MAS) had increased nuclear hypersegmentation compared to
              CD16+CD62L+ neutrophils. Serum levels of S100A8/A9 and S100A12
              were strongly correlated with peripheral blood neutrophil counts.
              Neutrophils from active SJIA patients did not show enhanced
              resting S100 protein release; however, regardless of disease
              activity, neutrophils from SJIA patients did show enhanced
              S100A8/A9 release upon PMA stimulation compared to control
              neutrophils. Furthermore, whole transcriptome analysis of highly
              purified neutrophils from children with active SJIA identified
              214 differentially expressed genes (DEG) compared to neutrophils
              from healthy controls. The most significantly upregulated gene
              pathway was Immune System Process, including AIM2, IL18RAP, and
              NLRC4. Interestingly, this gene set showed intermediate levels of
              expression in neutrophils from patients with long-standing CID
              yet persistent serum IL-18 elevation. Indeed, all patient samples
              regardless of disease activity demonstrated elevated inflammatory
              gene expression, including inflammasome components and S100A8.
              Conclusion: We identify features of neutrophil activation in SJIA
              patients with both active disease and CID, including a
              proinflammatory gene expression signature, reflecting persistent
              innate immune activation. Taken together, these studies expand

              statistically affect the demographic rate of aging. Of 30 genetic
              manipulations previously reported to extend life span, for only
              two we found evidence of retarding demographic aging: Cisd2 and

              expression patterns, acting sites, and roles in apoptotic DNA
              degradation and development are unclear. We have conducted a
              comprehensive analysis of three C. elegans DNase II genes and
              found that nuc-1 plays a major role, crn-6 plays an auxiliary
              role, and crn-7 plays a negligible role in resolving 3' OH DNA
              breaks generated in apoptotic cells. Promoter swapping
              experiments suggest that crn-6 but not crn-7 can partially
              substitute for nuc-1 in mediating apoptotic DNA degradation and
              both fail to replace nuc-1 in degrading bacterial DNA in

              non-overlapping expression patterns, both CRN-6 and NUC-1 can

              they are likely secreted nucleases that are retaken up by other
              cells to exert DNA degradation functions. Removal or disruption

              DNA degradation across its expression border. Furthermore,
              blocking cell corpse engulfment does not affect apoptotic DNA
              degradation mediated by nuc-1, suggesting that NUC-1 acts in
              apoptotic cells rather than in phagocytes to resolve 3' OH DNA

              which exhibit a complete apoptotic phenotype. SK-N-AS cell death
              is a caspase-dependent process that can be impaired by the
              pan-caspase inhibitor q-VD-OPh. The endogenous inhibitor of
              DFF40/CAD, ICAD, is correctly processed, and dff40/cad cDNA
              sequence does not reveal mutations altering its amino acid

              SK-N-AS resting cells express comparable levels of DFF40/CAD.
              However, the endonuclease is poorly expressed in the cytosolic
              fraction of healthy SK-N-AS cells. Despite this differential
              subcellular distribution of DFF40/CAD, we find no differences in
              the subcellular localization of both pro-caspase-3 and ICAD

              the preferential processing of ICAD in the cytosolic fraction
              allows the translocation of DFF40/CAD from this fraction to a

              DFF40/CAD detected in SK-N-AS cells determine the absence of DNA

              cytosolic levels can be restored by the overexpression of their

              degrading their chromatin into oligonucleosome-size fragments
              after staurosporine treatment. Altogether, the cytosolic levels

              Tumor-derived human microDNA is detected in the mouse circulation

              microDNA from paired tumor and normal lung tissue specimens

              human cancers releasing microDNA into the circulation, serum and
              plasma samples (12 lung and 11 ovarian cancer) collected prior to
              surgery are enriched for longer cell-free microDNA compared with

              receptor (TCR) repertoire, which is required for the recognition
              of foreign and self-antigens2, could serve as lineage tags to
              track these T cells in tumours3. Here we obtained transcriptomes
              of 11,138 single T cells from 12 patients with colorectal cancer,
              and developed single T cell analysis by RNA sequencing and TCR
              tracking (STARTRAC) indices to quantitatively analyse the dynamic
              relationships among 20 identified T cell subsets with distinct
              functions and clonalities. Although both CD8+ effector and
              'exhausted' T cells exhibited high clonal expansion, they were
              independently connected with tumour-resident CD8+ effector memory
              cells, implicating a TCR-based fate decision. Of the CD4+ T
              cells, most tumour-infiltrating T regulatory (Treg) cells showed
              clonal exclusivity, whereas certain Treg cell clones were
              developmentally linked to several T helper (TH) cell clones.
              Notably, we identified two IFNG+ TH1-like cell clusters in
              tumours that were associated with distinct IFN$\gamma$-regulating
              transcription factors -the GZMK+ effector memory T cells, which
              were associated with EOMES and RUNX3, and CXCL13+BHLHE40+
              TH1-like cell clusters, which were associated with BHLHE40. Only

              patients with microsatellite-instable tumours, and this might
              explain their favourable responses to immune-checkpoint blockade.
              Furthermore, IGFLR1 was highly expressed in both CXCL13+BHLHE40+
              TH1-like cells and CD8+ exhausted T cells and possessed
              co-stimulatory functions. Our integrated STARTRAC analyses
              provide a powerful approach to dissect the T cell properties in

              Both conditions are highly polygenic diseases in which stochastic

              Although the MHC region is a highly dense genetic area, most of
              the genetic basis of psoriatic disease within it resides in the
              HLA region. For decades, HLA-C*06 has been accepted as the main

              involvement in psoriatic disease. The role of HLA-B*27 in the

              Recent population case-control studies with adequate patient

  abstract = "We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale

              (FDRs), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences
              from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it assumes that
              the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal,
              with a mode at 0. This ``unimodal assumption'' (UA), although
              natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into
              standard FDR analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it
              brings many benefits. Specifically, the UA facilitates efficient
              and robust computation-estimating the unimodal distribution
              involves solving a simple convex optimization problem-and enables
              more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the
              method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect
              size estimate and corresponding standard error), rather than the
              one number usually used ($p$ value or $z$ score). When available,
              using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in
              measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates
              estimation of effects, and unlike standard FDR methods, our
              approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each
              effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a
              bridge between interval estimates and significance measures, we
              introduce the term ``local false sign rate'' to refer to the
              probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong and argue that
              it is a superior measure of significance than the local FDR
              because it is both more generally applicable and can be more

              low or highly variable, the maximum likelihood estimates for the
              LFCs has high variance, leading to large estimates not
              representative of true differences, and poor ranking of genes by
              effect size. One approach is to introduce filtering thresholds
              and pseudocounts to exclude or moderate estimated LFCs. Filtering
              may result in a loss of genes from the analysis with true
              differences in expression, while pseudocounts provide a limited
              solution that must be adapted per dataset. Here, we propose the
              use of a heavy-tailed Cauchy prior distribution for effect sizes,
              which avoids the use of filter thresholds or pseudocounts. The
              proposed method, Approximate Posterior Estimation for GLM,
              apeglm, has lower bias than previously proposed shrinkage
              estimators, while still reducing variance for those genes with
              little information for statistical inference. Availability: The

              forward. This is not unexpected because skull injuries are
              overwhelmingly more common than glioblastoma. This paper presents
              a commentary based on the contributions of James Ewing, who
              established a major set of criteria for the recognition of an
              official relationship between trauma and cancer. Ewing's criteria

              facilitated the characterization of traumatic brain injuries

              resonance imaging. Discussions of the various criteria that have
              since developed are now being conducted, and those of an
              unnecessarily limiting nature are being highlighted. Three
              transcription factors associated with traumatic brain injury have
              been identified: p53, hypoxia-inducible factor-1$\alpha$, and
              c-MYC. A role for these three transcription factors in the
              relationship between traumatic brain injury and glioblastoma is
              suggested; this role may support a cause-and-effect link with the

              unknown. In this study, the role and mechanism of microRNA-149
              (miR-149) in glioma are investigated. We show that miR-149 is
              expressed at substantially higher levels in glioma than in normal
              tissues. Stable overexpression of miR-149 augments potent
              prosurvival activity, as evidenced by promotion of cell
              viability, inhibition of apoptosis, and induced xenografted tumor
              growth in vivo. We further show that Caspase-2 is identified as a
              functional target of miR-149 and expression of caspase-2 is
              inversely associated with miR-149 in vitro. In addition, miR-149
              promotes tumor survival in the U87-MG and A172 cell lines and it
              targets caspase-2 via inactivation of the p53 and p21 pathways.
              There results support a special role for miR-149 by targeting
              Caspase-2 to impact on p53 signaling pathway. We speculate that
              miR-149 has distinct biological functions in p53 wild type cells

              accurate information on gene transcription. However, the method
              cannot accurately estimate duplicated genes expression. Several
              strategies have been previously used (drop duplicated genes,
              distribute uniformly the reads, or estimate expression), but all
              of them provide biased results. RESULTS: We provide here a tool,
              called mmquant, for computing gene expression, included
              duplicated genes. If a read maps at different positions, the tool
              detects that the corresponding genes are duplicated; it merges
              the genes and creates a merged gene. The counts of ambiguous
              reads is then based on the input genes and the merged genes.
              CONCLUSION: mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: RNA sequencing is a widely used technology for
              differential expression analysis. However, the RNA-Seq do not
              provide accurate absolute measurements and the results can be
              different for each pipeline used. The major problem in
              statistical analysis of RNA-Seq and in the omics data in general,
              is the small sample size with respect to the large number of
              variables. In addition, experimental design must be taken into
              account and few tools consider it. RESULTS: We propose OMICfpp, a
              method for the statistical analysis of RNA-Seq paired design
              data. First, we obtain a p-value for each case-control pair using
              a binomial test. These p-values are aggregated using an ordered
              weighted average (OWA) with a given orness previously chosen. The
              aggregated p-value from the original data is compared with the
              aggregated p-value obtained using the same method applied to
              random pairs. These new pairs are generated using between-pairs
              and complete randomization distributions. This randomization
              p-value is used as a raw p-value to test the differential
              expression of each gene. The OMICfpp method is evaluated using
              public data sets of 68 sample pairs from patients with colorectal
              cancer. We validate our results through bibliographic search of
              the reported genes and using simulated data set. Furthermore, we
              compared our results with those obtained by the methods edgeR and
              DESeq2 for paired samples. Finally, we propose new target genes
              to validate these as gene expression signatures in colorectal
              cancer. OMICfpp is available at
              http://www.uv.es/ayala/software/OMICfpp\_0.2.tar.gz .
              CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that OMICfpp is an accurate method
              for differential expression analysis in RNA-Seq data with paired
              design. In addition, we propose the use of randomized p-values

              target genes for experimental validation.",

  abstract = "Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data
              from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly
              simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping
              reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped
              genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a
              relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads)
              extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the
              optimal location. When the read length is <160 bp, overlapping
              subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are
              then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information
              between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The
              strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already
              been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is
              sensitive because no individual subread is required to map
              exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by
              other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be
              supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends
              easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain
              sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It

              a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
              non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
              lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
              technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
              high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
              limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80
              billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
              the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
              based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm
              that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed
              suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching
              procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in
              mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2
              $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core
              server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity
              and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of
              canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and
              chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping
              full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse
              transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we
              experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions
              with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of
              the STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR

              (∼21 nucleotides [nt]) as well as the large size and complexity
              of plant and animal genomes. While several tools have been
              developed for high-throughput mapping of longer mRNA-seq reads
              (>30 nt), there are few that are specifically designed for
              mapping of smRNA reads including microRNAs. The accuracy of these

              of broad polyclonal responses to pyrophosphate antigens (pAg),
              they are implicated in immunity to a diverse range of infections.
              Previously V$\gamma$9V$\delta$2+ development was thought to
              involve postnatal selection and amplification of public
              V$\gamma$9 clonotypes in response to microbial stimuli. However,
              recent data indicate the V$\gamma$9V$\delta$2+ T-cell receptor
              (TCR) repertoire, which is generated early in gestation, is
              dominated by public V$\gamma$9 clonotypes from birth. These
              chains bear highly distinct features compared to V$\gamma$9
              chains from V$\delta$1+ T-cells, due either to temporal
              differences in recombination of each subset and/or potentially
              prenatal selection of pAg-reactive clonotypes. While these
              processes result in a semi-invariant repertoire featuring
              V$\gamma$9 sequences preconfigured for pAg recognition,
              alterations in TCR$\delta$ repertoires between neonate and adult

              tumor-infiltrating $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells, which appear to have

              those of cytotoxic T and Th1 cells and M1 macrophages than those
              of Th2 cells and M2 macrophages. Although the most abundant
              $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells were V$\gamma$9V$\delta$2 T cells in

              with or without a reference genome",
  author   = "Li, Bo and Dewey, Colin N",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript
              abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript
              quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that
              map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly
              important for quantification with de novo transcriptome
              assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is
              difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same
              gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq
              experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and
              whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments.
              RESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for
              quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or
              paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95\%
              credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also
              simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the
              software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in
              combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables
              accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced
              genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or
              comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a
              reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to
              effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate
              gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large
              numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates
              of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may
              be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the
              number of possible splice forms for each gene. CONCLUSIONS: RSEM
              is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying
              transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on
              the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful
              for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In
              addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient
              design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is
              currently relatively expensive.",

              a signature, ``CA20'', comprising centrosome structural genes and
              genes whose dysregulation is implicated in inducing CA. We found
              that CA20 was a significant independent predictor of worse

              i.e., tumors of epithelial origin. Such aneuploidies result in
              tumor specific genomic copy number alterations. The patterns of
              genomic imbalances are tumor specific, and to a certain extent
              specific for defined stages of tumor development. Genomic
              imbalances occur already in premalignant precursor lesions, i.e.,
              before the transition to invasive disease, and their distribution
              is maintained in metastases, and in cell lines derived from
              primary tumors. These observations are consistent with the
              interpretation that tumor specific genomic imbalances are drivers
              of malignant transformation. Naturally, this precipitates the
              question of how such imbalances influence the expression of
              resident genes. A number of laboratories have systematically
              integrated copy number alterations with gene expression changes
              in primary tumors and metastases, cell lines, and experimental
              models of aneuploidy to address the question as to whether
              genomic imbalances deregulate the expression of one or few key
              genes, or rather affect the cancer transcriptome more globally.
              The majority of these studies showed that gene expression levels
              follow genomic copy number. Therefore, gross genomic copy number
              changes, including aneuploidies of entire chromosome arms and

  abstract = "Background: Inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene by
              deletion occurs in 20-30\% of prostate cancer tumors and loss
              strongly correlates with a worse outcome. PTEN loss of function
              not only leads to activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, but is also
              thought to affect genome stability and increase levels of tumor
              aneuploidy. We performed an in silico integrative genomic and
              transcriptomic analysis of 491 TCGA prostate cancer tumors. These
              data were used to map the genomic sizes of PTEN gene deletions
              and to characterize levels of instability and patterns of
              aneuploidy acquisition. Results: PTEN homozygous deletions had a
              significant increase in aneuploidy compared to PTEN tumors
              without an apparent deletion, and hemizygous deletions showed an
              intermediate aneuploidy profile. A supervised clustering of
              somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) demonstrated that the size
              of PTEN deletions was not random, but comprised five distinct
              subtypes: (1) ``Small Interstitial'' (70 bp-789Kb); (2) ``Large
              Interstitial'' (1-7 MB); (3) ``Large Proximal'' (3-65 MB); (4)
              ``Large Terminal'' (8-64 MB), and (5) ``Extensive'' (71-132 MB).
              Many of the deleted fragments in each subtype were flanked by low
              copy repetitive (LCR) sequences. SCNAs such as gain at
              3q21.1-3q29 and deletions at 8p, RB1, TP53 and TMPRSS2-ERG were
              variably present in all subtypes. Other SCNAs appeared to be
              recurrent in some deletion subtypes, but absent from others. To
              determine how the aneuploidy influenced global levels of gene
              expression, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis.
              One deletion subtype (Large Interstitial) was characterized by
              gene expression changes associated with angiogenesis and cell
              adhesion, structure, and metabolism. Logistic regression
              demonstrated that this deletion subtype was associated with a
              high Gleason score (HR = 2.386; 95\% C.I. 1.245-4.572),
              extraprostatic extension (HR = 2.423, 95\% C.I. 1.157-5.075), and
              metastasis (HR = 7.135; 95\% C.I. 1.540-33.044). Univariate and
              multivariate Cox Regression showed that presence of this deletion
              subtype was also strongly predictive of disease recurrence.
              Conclusions: Our findings indicate that genomic deletions of PTEN
              fall into five different size distributions, with breakpoints
              that often occur close LCR regions, and that each subtype is
              associated with a characteristic aneuploidy signature. The Large
              Interstitial deletion had a distinct gene expression signature
              that was related to cancer progression and was also predictive of
              a worse prognosis.",

              responses. While MHC binding is required for a peptide to be
              presented to T cells, not all MHC binders are immunogenic. The
              interaction of a TCR to the p:MHC complex holds a key, but
              currently poorly comprehended, component for our understanding of
              this variation in the immunogenicity of MHC binding peptides.
              Here, we demonstrate that identification of the cognate target of
              a TCR from a set of p:MHC complexes to a high degree is
              achievable using simple force-field energy terms. Building a

              specific for defined human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class

              database of TCR sequences with known antigen specificities and a
              probabilistic TCR rearrangement model to estimate the baseline
              frequencies of TCRs specific to distinct antigens

              non-immunogenic peptides is used to link baseline T-cell
              frequencies with epitope immunogenicity. RESULTS: Our findings
              revealed a high degree of variability in the prevalence of T
              cells specific for different antigens that could be explained by
              the physicochemical properties of the corresponding HLA class
              I-bound peptides. The occurrence of certain rearrangements was
              influenced by ancestry and HLA class I restriction, and umbilical
              cord blood samples contained higher frequencies of common
              pathogen-specific TCRs. We also identified a quantitative link

              highly diverse to account for the highly heterogeneous antigenic
              world. During the response to a virus multiple individual clones
              of antigen specific CD8+ (Ag-specific) T cells can be identified

              Advances in single-cell technologies have provided the potential
              to study Ag-specific T cell heterogeneity at both surface

              successfully reconstructed productive TCR$\alpha$$\beta$ in 56 of

              TCR$\alpha$$\beta$ in 2 cells. The method was validated via

  abstract = "The T cell compartment must contain diversity in both T cell
              receptor (TCR) repertoire and cell state to provide effective
              immunity against pathogens. However, it remains unclear how
              differences in the TCR contribute to heterogeneity in T cell
              state. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can allow
              simultaneous measurement of TCR sequence and global
              transcriptional profile from single cells. However, current
              methods for TCR inference from scRNA-seq are limited in their
              sensitivity and require long sequencing reads, thus increasing
              the cost and decreasing the number of cells that can be feasibly
              analyzed. Here we present TRAPeS, a publicly available tool that
              can efficiently extract TCR sequence information from short-read
              scRNA-seq libraries. We apply it to investigate heterogeneity in
              the CD8+ T cell response in humans and mice, and show that it is
              accurate and more sensitive than existing approaches. Coupling
              TRAPeS with transcriptome analysis of CD8+ T cells specific for a
              single epitope from Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), we show that the
              recently described 'naive-like' memory population have
              significantly longer CDR3 regions and greater divergence from
              germline sequence than do effector-memory phenotype cells. This
              suggests that TCR usage is associated with the differentiation
              state of the CD8+ T cell response to YFV.",

              observational study including all consecutive patients with a
              diagnosis of any systemic autoimmune disease admitted to the
              medical ICU in a tertiary hospital between 1999 and 2007. Factors
              associated with reduced survival were identified by means of log
              rank test and backward stepwise Cox regression. RESULTS:
              Thirty-seven patients (26 females) were included with median age
              being 44.3 years (interquartilic range [IQR]: 31.3). Sixteen
              (43.2\%) patients had systemic lupus erythematosus, 9 (24.3\%)
              had systemic vasculitis, 4 (10.8\%) had systemic sclerosis and 4
              (10.8\%) had primary antiphospholipid syndrome. The main reason
              for ICU admission was autoimmune disease flare-up in 20 (54.0\%)
              patients, followed by infections in 12 (32.4\%). Median APACHE II
              at admission was 17 (IQR 7). At the end of follow-up, 15 (40.5\%)
              patients died, 10 (27\%) during hospitalisation (7 in the ICU)
              and 5 after hospital discharge. Factors associated with reduced
              long-term survival were: APACHE II score $\geq$18 (HR 6.02, 95\%
              CI 1.76-20.62), age <45 years (HR 6.54, 95\% CI 1.84-23.29),
              presence of any previous chronic disease (HR 18.20, 95\% CI

              stay (HR 22.87, 95\% CI 4.31-121.30). CONCLUSIONS: The long-term
              survival of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases admitted
              to the ICU was related with age, higher APACHE II score, previous

              methodology based on multivariate descriptive methods such as
              principal component analysis and multiple correspondence analyses
              was performed to summarize sets of related variables with strong
              associations and common clinical context. RESULTS: Fifty adult
              patients with ADs with a mean age of 46.7$\pm$17.55 years were
              assessed. The two most common diagnoses were systemic lupus
              erythematosus and systemic sclerosis, registered in 45\% and 20\%
              of patients, respectively. The main causes of admission to ICU
              were infection and AD flare up, observed in 36\% and 24\%,
              respectively. Mortality during ICU stay was 24\%. The length of
              hospital stay before ICU admission, shock, vasopressors,
              mechanical ventilation, abdominal sepsis, Glasgow score and

  author   = "Armstrong, Richard A",
  abstract = "PURPOSE: The Bonferroni correction adjusts probability (p) values
              because of the increased risk of a type I error when making
              multiple statistical tests. The routine use of this test has been
              criticised as deleterious to sound statistical judgment, testing
              the wrong hypothesis, and reducing the chance of a type I error
              but at the expense of a type II error; yet it remains popular in
              ophthalmic research. The purpose of this article was to survey
              the use of the Bonferroni correction in research articles
              published in three optometric journals, viz. Ophthalmic \&
              Physiological Optics, Optometry \& Vision Science, and Clinical
              \& Experimental Optometry, and to provide advice to authors
              contemplating multiple testing. RECENT FINDINGS: Some authors
              ignored the problem of multiple testing while others used the
              method uncritically with no rationale or discussion. A variety of
              methods of correcting p values were employed, the Bonferroni
              method being the single most popular. Bonferroni was used in a
              variety of circumstances, most commonly to correct the
              experiment-wise error rate when using multiple 't' tests or as a
              post-hoc procedure to correct the family-wise error rate
              following analysis of variance (anova). Some studies quoted
              adjusted p values incorrectly or gave an erroneous rationale.
              SUMMARY: Whether or not to use the Bonferroni correction depends
              on the circumstances of the study. It should not be used
              routinely and should be considered if: (1) a single test of the
              'universal null hypothesis' (Ho ) that all tests are not
              significant is required, (2) it is imperative to avoid a type I
              error, and (3) a large number of tests are carried out without
              preplanned hypotheses.",

              and susceptibility to, or prevalence of, a range of diseases.
              Unfortunately, this great technological power has not always been
              accompanied by great statistical responsibility. I will focus on
              one aspect of statistical analysis, multiple hypothesis
              correction, that is absolutely required, yet often absolutely
              ignored, for responsible interpretation of this literature. Many
              existing studies perform comparisons between incidences of a
              large number (N) of different mtDNA features and a given disease,
              reporting all those yielding p values under 0.05 as significant
              links. But when many comparisons are performed, it is highly
              likely that several p values under 0.05 will emerge, by chance,
              in the absence of any underlying link. A suitable correction (for
              example, Bonferroni correction, requiring p < 0.05/N) must,
              therefore, be employed to avoid reporting false positive results.
              The absence of such corrections means that there is good reason
              to believe that many links reported between mtDNA features and
              various diseases are false; a state of affairs that is profoundly
              negative both for fundamental biology and for public health. I
              will show that statistics matching those claimed to illustrate
              significant links can arise, with a high probability, when no
              such link exists, and that these claims should thus be discarded
              until results of suitable statistical reliability are provided. I
              also discuss some strategies for responsible analysis and

              uncharacterized. Here, using zebrafish knockdown and knockout
              models of the capn3a and nid1a genes, we show that mRNA bearing a
              premature termination codon (PTC) promptly triggers a GCR that
              involves Upf3a and components of the COMPASS complex. Unlike
              capn3a-knockdown embryos, which have small livers, and
              nid1a-knockdown embryos, which have short body lengths2,
              capn3a-null and nid1a-null mutants appear normal. These
              phenotypic differences have been attributed to the upregulation
              of other genes in the same families. By analysing six uniquely
              designed transgenes, we demonstrate that the GCR is dependent on
              both the presence of a PTC and the nucleotide sequence of the
              transgene mRNA, which is homologous to the compensatory

              histone H3 Lys4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at the transcription
              start site regions of the compensatory genes. These findings
              provide a potential mechanistic basis for the GCR, and may help

              organisms may also respond to mutations by transcriptional
              adaptation, a process by which related gene(s) are upregulated
              independently of protein feedback loops. However, the prevalence

              transcribe the mutated gene do not exhibit transcriptional

              spectrum of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders involving the
              skin, have collectively increased in incidence over the last 40
              years. S{\'e}zary syndrome is an aggressive form of CTCL
              characterized by significant presence of malignant cells in both
              the blood and skin. The guarded prognosis for S{\'e}zary syndrome
              reflects a lack of reliably effective therapy, due, in part, to
              an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis.Experimental
              Design: Using single-cell sequencing of RNA and the
              machine-learning reverse graph embedding approach in the Monocle
              package, we defined a model featuring distinct transcriptomic
              states within S{\'e}zary syndrome. Gene expression used to
              differentiate the unique transcriptional states were further used
              to develop a boosted tree classification for early versus late
              CTCL disease.Results: Our analysis showed the involvement of
              FOXP3+ malignant T cells during clonal evolution, transitioning
              from FOXP3+ T cells to GATA3+ or IKZF2+ (HELIOS) tumor cells.
              Transcriptomic diversities in a clonal tumor can be used to
              predict disease stage, and we were able to characterize a gene
              signature that predicts disease stage with close to 80\%
              accuracy. FOXP3 was found to be the most important factor to
              predict early disease in CTCL, along with another 19 genes used
              to predict CTCL stage.Conclusions: This work offers insight into
              the heterogeneity of S{\'e}zary syndrome, providing better
              understanding of the transcriptomic diversities within a clonal
              tumor. This transcriptional heterogeneity can predict tumor stage

  abstract = "BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The enteric nervous system (ENS) is the
              largest branch of the peripheral nervous system, comprising
              complex networks of neurons and glia, which are present
              throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Although development of a
              fully functional ENS is required for gastrointestinal motility,
              little is known about the ontogeny of ENS function in humans. We
              studied the development of neuronal subtypes and the emergence of
              evoked electrical activity in the developing human ENS. METHODS:
              Human fetal gut samples (obtained via the MRC-Wellcome Trust
              Human Developmental Biology Resource-UK) were characterized by
              immunohistochemistry, calcium imaging, RNA sequencing, and
              quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses.
              RESULTS: Human fetal colon samples have dense neuronal networks
              at the level of the myenteric plexus by embryonic week (EW) 12,
              with expression of excitatory neurotransmitter and synaptic
              markers. By contrast, markers of inhibitory neurotransmitters
              were not observed until EW14. Electrical train stimulation of
              internodal strands did not evoke activity in the ENS of EW12 or
              EW14 tissues. However, compound calcium activation was observed
              at EW16, which was blocked by the addition of 1 $\mu$mol/L
              tetrodotoxin. Expression analyses showed that this activity was
              coincident with increases in expressions of genes encoding
              proteins involved in neurotransmission and action potential
              generation. CONCLUSIONS: In analyses of human fetal intestinal
              samples, we followed development of neuronal diversity,
              electrical excitability, and network formation in the ENS. These
              processes are required to establish the functional enteric
              circuitry. Further studies could increase our understanding of
              the pathogenesis of a range of congenital enteric neuropathies.",

              regulatory networks, which may be initiated by a subtle shift in
              expression levels of specific genes. This can be achieved by
              intermediary regulatory processes that include microRNA and long

              well-documented microRNA profiles in Treg and Tconv, and these

              specific set of target genes, including FOXP3 itself. This type

              disorders. However, this is challenging because of the limited
              accessibility of functional human brain tissue. Here, we
              developed a new differentiation method of human induced
              pluripotent stem cells to generate three-dimensional brain
              organoids that contain oligodendrocytes as well as neurons and
              astrocytes, called human oligodendrocyte spheroids. We found that
              oligodendrocyte lineage cells derived in human oligodendrocyte
              spheroids transitioned through developmental stages similar to
              primary human oligodendrocytes and that the migration of
              oligodendrocyte lineage cells and their susceptibility to
              lysolecithin exposure could be captured by live imaging.
              Moreover, their morphology changed as they matured over time in
              vitro and started myelinating neurons. We anticipate that this
              method can be used to study oligodendrocyte development,
              myelination, and interactions with other major cell types in the
              CNS.",

              http://www.imgt.org ), was created in 1989 in Montpellier, France
              (CNRS and Montpellier University) to manage the huge and complex
              diversity of the antigen receptors, and is at the origin of
              immunoinformatics, a science at the interface between
              immunogenetics and bioinformatics. Immunoglobulins (IG) or
              antibodies and T cell receptors (TR) are managed and described in
              the IMGT\textregistered{} databases and tools at the level of
              receptor, chain and domain. The analysis of the IG and TR
              variable (V) domain rearranged nucleotide sequences is performed
              by IMGT/V-QUEST (online since 1997, 50 sequences per batch) and,
              for next generation sequencing (NGS), by IMGT/HighV-QUEST, the
              high throughput version of IMGT/V-QUEST (portal begun in 2010,
              500,000 sequences per batch). In vitro combinatorial libraries of
              engineered antibody single chain Fragment variable (scFv) which
              mimic the in vivo natural diversity of the immune adaptive
              responses are extensively screened for the discovery of novel
              antigen binding specificities. However the analysis of NGS full
              length scFv (~850 bp) represents a challenge as they contain two
              V domains connected by a linker and there is no tool for the
              analysis of two V domains in a single chain. METHODS: The
              functionality ``Analyis of single chain Fragment variable
              (scFv)'' has been implemented in IMGT/V-QUEST and, for NGS, in
              IMGT/HighV-QUEST for the analysis of the two V domains of IG and
              TR scFv. It proceeds in five steps: search for a first closest
              V-REGION, full characterization of the first V-(D)-J-REGION, then
              search for a second V-REGION and full characterization of the
              second V-(D)-J-REGION, and finally linker delimitation. RESULTS:
              For each sequence or NGS read, positions of the 5'V-DOMAIN,
              linker and 3'V-DOMAIN in the scFv are provided in the
              'V-orientated' sense. Each V-DOMAIN is fully characterized (gene
              identification, sequence description, junction analysis,
              characterization of mutations and amino changes). The
              functionality is generic and can analyse any IG or TR single
              chain nucleotide sequence containing two V domains, provided that
              the corresponding species IMGT reference directory is available.
              CONCLUSION: The ``Analysis of single chain Fragment variable
              (scFv)'' implemented in IMGT/V-QUEST and, for NGS, in
              IMGT/HighV-QUEST provides the identification and full

              molecular identifier (UMI) library-based strategy to investigate
              with high accuracy the TCR clonal repertoire by high throughput
              sequencing (HTS) technology. cDNA-TCR $\beta$-chain libraries
              were sequenced from 2 million peripheral mononuclear cells
              (PBMCs) in 14 HAM/TSP patients, 34 MS patients and 20 healthy
              controls (HC). While HAM/TSP patients showed a higher clonal
              T-cell expansion compared to MS and HC, increase of the TCR
              clonal expansion was inversely correlated with the diversity of
              TCR repertoire in all subjects. In addition, longitudinal
              analysis of TCR repertoires from HAM/TSP patients demonstrated a
              correlation of the TCR clonal expansion with HTLV-I proviral
              load. Surprisingly, MS patients showed a higher diversity of TCR
              repertoires than other groups. Despite higher TCR clonal
              expansions in HAM/TSP patients, no disease-specific TCRs were
              shared among patients. Only non-shared or ``private'' TCR
              repertoires was observed. While no clones that shared the same
              CDR3 amino acid sequences were seen in either HC or MS patients,
              there was a cluster of related CDR3 amino acid sequences observed
              for 18 out of 34 MS patients when evaluated by phylogenetic tree

              contribute to generating an autoreactive CD4+ T cell repertoire

              Differences in T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires may identify
              HPV16-infected women at highest-risk for progression to cancer.
              We conducted a proof-of-principle study nested within the
              Guanacaste HPV Natural History Study to evaluate the utility of
              next-generation sequencing for interrogating the TCR repertoires
              among women who cleared and failed to clear cervical HPV16.
              METHODS: TCR repertoires of women with HPV16-related
              intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or higher (CIN3+; n = 25) were
              compared to women who cleared an incident HPV16 infection without
              developing precancer/cancer (n = 25). TCR diversity (richness and
              evenness) and relative abundance (RA) of gene segment (V [n =
              51], D [n = 2], J [n = 13]) usage was evaluated; receiver
              operating curve analysis assessed the ability to differentiate
              case-control status. RESULTS: TCR repertoire richness was
              associated with CIN3+ status (P = 0.001). Relative abundance (RA)
              of V-gene segments was enriched for associations between cases
              and controls. A single V-gene (TRBV6-7) was significantly
              associated with CIN3+ status (RA = 0.11\%, 0.16\%, among cases
              and controls, respectively, Bonferroni P = 0.0008). The estimated
              area under the curve using richness and V-gene segment RA was
              0.83 (95\% confidence interval: 0.73-0.90). CONCLUSIONS:
              Substantial differences in TCR repertoire among women with CIN3+
              compared to women who cleared infection were observed. IMPACT:
              This is the first study to use next-generation sequencing to
              investigate TCR repertoire in the context of HPV infection. These

              antidepressant-free patients with MDD without any somatic or
              psychiatric comorbidities (n = 20), who were individually matched
              for sex, age, body mass index, and smoking status to a

              repertoire were interrogated using a combination of flow
              cytometry, gene expression analysis, and next generation
              sequencing. T cells from MDD patients showed significantly lower
              surface expression of the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR6,
              which are known to be central to T cell differentiation and

              CD4+CD25highCD127low/- cells and higher FOXP3 mRNA expression in

              cells capable of recognizing a broad array of antigens. Each T
              cell9s specificity and affinity for antigens is determined by its
              T cell receptors (TCRs), which together across all T cells form a
              repertoire of tens of millions of unique receptors in each
              individual. Although many studies have examined how TCR
              repertoires change in response to disease or drugs, few have
              explored the temporal dynamics of the TCR repertoire in healthy
              individuals. Results: Here we report immunosequencing of TCR
              chains (TCR ) from the blood of three healthy individuals at
              eight time points over one year. TCR repertoires from samples of
              all T cells and memory T cells clearly clustered by individual,
              confirming that TCR repertoires are specific to individuals
              across time. This individuality was absent from TCRs from naive T
              cells, suggesting that these differences result from an
              individual9s antigen exposure history. Many characteristics of
              the TCR repertoire (e.g., alpha diversity, clonality) were stable
              across time, although we found evidence of T cell expansion
              dynamics even within healthy individuals. We further identified a
              subset of ``persistent'' TCRs present across all time points, and
              these receptors were rich in clonal and public receptors.
              Conclusions: Our results revealed persistent receptors that may
              play a key role in immune system maintenance. They further
              highlight the importance of longitudinal sampling of the immune
              system and provide a much-needed baseline for TCR dynamics in

              or greater than, that of the human brain. T cell based immune
              response is involved with practically every part of human
              physiology, and high-throughput biology needed to follow the
              T-cell repertoire has made great leaps with the advent of massive
              parallel sequencing [1]. Nevertheless, tools to handle and
              observe the dynamics of this complexity have only recently
              started to emerge [e.g., 2, 3, 4] in parallel with sequencing
              technologies. Here, we present a network-based view of the
              dynamics of the T cell repertoire, during the course of mammary
              tumors development in a mouse model. The transition from the T
              cell receptor as a feature, to network-based clustering, followed
              by network-based temporal analyses, provides novel insights to
              the workings of the system and provides novel tools to observe
              cancer progression via the perspective of the immune system. The
              crux of the approach here is at the network-motivated clustering.
              The purpose of the clustering step is not merely data reduction
              and exposing structures, but rather to detect hubs, or
              attractors, within the T cell receptor repertoire that might shed
              light on the behavior of the immune system as a dynamic network.
              The Clone-Attractor is in fact an extension of the clone concept,
              i.e., instead of looking at particular clones we observe the
              extended clonal network by assigning clusters to graph nodes and
              edges to adjacent clusters (editing distance metric). Viewing the
              system as dynamical brings to the fore the notion of an
              attractors landscape, hence the possibility to chart this space
              and map the sample state at a given time to a vector in this
              large space. Based on this representation we applied two
              different methods to demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying
              changes in the repertoire that correlate with changes in the
              phenotype: (1) network analysis of the TCR repertoire in which
              two measures were calculated and demonstrated the ability to
              differentiate control from transgenic samples, and, (2) machine
              learning classifier capable of both stratifying control and

              (pMHC)-tetramer-sorted cells and structural data. From this
              analysis we developed an algorithm that we term GLIPH (grouping
              of lymphocyte interactions by paratope hotspots) to cluster TCRs
              with a high probability of sharing specificity owing to both
              conserved motifs and global similarity of
              complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. We show
              that GLIPH can reliably group TCRs of common specificity from
              different donors, and that conserved CDR3 motifs help to define
              the TCR clusters that are often contact points with the antigenic
              peptides. As an independent validation, we analysed 5,711
              TCR$\beta$ chain sequences from reactive CD4 T cells from 22
              individuals with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We

              containing TCRs from multiple individuals. These TCR groups
              typically shared HLA alleles, allowing prediction of the likely
              HLA restriction, and a large number of M. tuberculosis T cell
              epitopes enabled us to identify pMHC ligands for all five of the

              large numbers of TCR sequences and define TCR specificity groups
              shared by TCRs and individuals, which should greatly accelerate

              this potential diversity, TCRs from T cells that recognize the

              files and high-level algorithms, which seek to extract biological
              or pathological information. The latest generation of

              T cells, is responsible for the recognition of the antigen-major
              histocompatibility complex, leading to the initiation of an
              inflammatory response. Analysing the TCR repertoire may help to
              gain a better understanding of the immune system features and of
              the aetiology and progression of diseases, in particular those
              with unknown antigenic triggers. The extreme diversity of the TCR
              repertoire represents a major analytical challenge; this has led
              to the development of specialized methods which aim to
              characterize the TCR repertoire in-depth. Currently, next
              generation sequencing based technologies are most widely employed
              for the high-throughput analysis of the immune cell repertoire.
              RESULTS: Here, we report on the latest methodological
              advancements in the field by describing and comparing the
              available tools; from the choice of the starting material and
              library preparation method, to the sequencing technologies and

              than others. Finally, due to possible method specific biases,

              effective immune response. TCR-repertoire diversity declines with
              age. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have a prematurely
              aged T cell system which is associated with defective T
              cell-mediated immunity. Recently, we showed that ESRD may
              significantly skew the TCR V$\beta$-repertoire. Here, we assessed
              the impact of ESRD on the TCR V$\beta$-repertoire within
              different T cell subsets using a multiparameter
              flow-cytometry-based assay, controlling for effects of aging and
              CMV latency. Percentages of 24 different TCR V$\beta$-families
              were tested in circulating naive and memory T cell subsets of 10
              ESRD patients and 10 age- and CMV-serostatus-matched healthy
              individuals (HI). The Gini-index, a parameter used in economics
              to describe the distribution of income, was calculated to
              determine the extent of skewing at the subset level taking into
              account frequencies of all 24 TCR V$\beta$-families. In addition,
              using HI as reference population, the differential impact of ESRD
              was assessed on clonal expansion at the level of an individual
              TCR V$\beta$-family. CD8+, but not CD4+, T cell differentiation
              was associated with higher Gini-TCR indices. Gini-TCR indices
              were already significantly higher for different CD8+ memory T
              cell subsets of younger ESRD patients compared to their
              age-matched HI. ESRD induced expansions of not one TCR
              V$\beta$-family in particular and expansions were predominantly
              observed within the CD8+ T cell compartment. All ESRD patients
              had expanded TCR V$\beta$-families within total CD8+ T cells and
              the median (IQ range) number of expanded TCR
              V$\beta$-families/patient amounted to 2 (1-4). Interestingly,
              ESRD also induced clonal expansions of TCR V$\beta$-families
              within naive CD8+ T cells as 8 out of 10 patients had expanded
              TCR V$\beta$-families. The median (IQ range) number of expanded
              families/patient amounted to 1 (1-1) within naive CD8+ T cells.
              In conclusion, loss of renal function skews the TCR
              V$\beta$-repertoire already in younger patients by inducing
              expansions of different TCR V$\beta$-families within the various
              T cell subsets, primarily affecting the CD8+ T cell compartment.
              This skewed TCR V$\beta$-repertoire may be associated with a less
              broad and diverse T cell-mediated immunity.",

              Repertoire diversity is achieved centrally by somatic
              recombination of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and peripherally by
              somatic hypermutation and Ig heavy chain class-switching.
              Throughout these processes, there is selection for functional
              gene rearrangements, selection against gene combinations
              resulting in self-reactive BCRs, and selection for BCRs with high

              investigation of BCR repertoires from different groups of B cells
              can provide information on stages of B cell development and shed
              light on the etiology of B cell pathologies. In most instances,
              the third complementarity determining region of the Ig heavy

              majority of patients fall into two clinically distinguishable

              repertoire is unknown. To address this question, we performed
              deep sequencing of the BCR repertoire of AChR-MG, MuSK-MG, and
              healthy subjects to generate ∼518,000 unique VH and VL sequences

              repertoire sequencing provides detailed information about the
              functionality and abnormalities of the B-cell system. However, it
              is mostly unknown how the BCR repertoire is altered in the
              context of primary immunodeficiencies (PID) and whether findings
              are consistent throughout phenotypes and genotypes. We have
              performed an extensive literature search of the published work on
              BCR repertoire sequencing in PID patients, including several
              forms of predominantly antibody disorders and combined
              immunodeficiencies. It is somewhat surprising that BCR
              repertoires, even from severe clinical phenotypes, often show
              only mild abnormalities and that diversity or immunoglobulin gene
              segment usage is generally preserved to some extent. Despite the
              great variety of wet laboratory and analytical methods that were
              used in the different studies, several findings are common to
              most investigated PIDs, such as the increased usage of gene
              segments that are associated with self-reactivity. These findings
              suggest that BCR repertoire characteristics may be used to assess
              the functionality of the B-cell compartment irrespective of the
              underlying defect. With the use of NGS approaches, there is now
              the opportunity to apply BCR repertoire sequencing to multiple
              patients and explore the PID BCR repertoire in more detail.
              Ultimately, using BCR repertoire sequencing in translational

              fully functional T-cells that bear T-cell receptors (TCRs) with
              low affinity for cognate antigen. This issue is particularly
              pronounced for anticancer and autoimmune T-cells as self-reactive
              T-cell populations are enriched for low-affinity TCRs due to the
              removal of cells with higher affinity receptors by immune
              tolerance mechanisms. Here, we stained a wide variety of
              self-reactive human T-cells using regular pMHC staining and an
              optimized technique that included: (i) protein kinase inhibitor
              (PKI), to prevent TCR triggering and internalization, and (ii)
              anti-fluorochrome antibody, to reduce reagent dissociation during
              washing steps. Lymphocytes derived from the peripheral blood of
              type 1 diabetes patients were stained with pMHC multimers made
              with epitopes from preproinsulin (PPI), insulin-$\beta$ chain,

              ankylosing spondylitis patients were stained with a multimerized
              epitope from vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor 1 (VIPR1)
              presented by HLA B*27:05. Optimized procedures stained an average
              of 40.5-fold (p = 0.01, range between 1.4 and 198) more cells
              than could be detected without the inclusion of PKI and
              cross-linking anti-fluorochrome antibody. Higher order pMHC
              dextramers recovered more cells than pMHC tetramers in parallel
              assays, and standard staining protocols with pMHC tetramers
              routinely recovered less cells than functional assays. HLA
              A*02:01-restricted PPI-specific and HLA B*27:05-restricted
              VIPR1-specific T-cell clones generated using the optimized

              antibody-conjugated magnetic beads enhanced staining of

              protocols, thus enabling rapid ex vivo isolation of autoimmune
              T-cells. We, therefore, conclude that regular pMHC tetramer

              As CD8+ T cells target the highly conserved, internal IAV
              proteins, they have the potential to increase heterosubtypic
              immunity. Early T-cell priming events influence lasting memory,
              which is required for long-term protection. However, the early
              responding, IAV-specific cells are difficult to monitor because
              of their low frequencies. Here, we tracked the dissemination of
              endogenous IAV-specific CD8+ T cells during the initial phases of
              the immune response following IAV infection. We exposed a
              significant population of recently activated, CD25+ CD43+
              IAV-specific T cells that were not detected by tetramer staining.
              By tracking this population, we found that initial T-cell priming

              address the pathogen at hand and therefore favor outgrowth of
              only high-affinity clones. In contrast, the memory pool benefits
              from greater clonal diversity to recognize and eliminate
              pathogens with mutations in their immunogenic epitopes. Effector
              and memory fates are ultimately the result of the same three
              signals that control T cell activation; T cell receptor (TCR)
              engagement together with co-stimulation and cytokines. Great
              progress has been made in our understanding of the
              transcriptional programs that drive effector or memory
              differentiation. However, how these two different programs result
              from the same initial cues is still a matter of debate. An
              emerging image is that not only the classical three signals
              determine T cell differentiation, but also the ability of cells
              to access these signals relative to that of other activated
              clones. Inter-clonal competition is therefore not only a
              selective force, but also a mediator of CD8 T cell fate. How this
              is regulated on a transcriptional level, especially in the

              in which only cells of high-affinity are supposed to survive, is

              literature that illustrates how antigen-affinity dependent
              inter-clonal competition shapes effector and memory populations
              in an environment of antigen affinity-driven selection. We argue

              compositions of fetal blood and liver and to phenotypically
              quantify the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during early
              human gestation. STUDY DESIGN: Fifty fetal blood samples and 50
              fetal livers were collected at 10 to 17 weeks' gestation and 8 to
              17 weeks' gestation, respectively. Investigations included fetal
              blood cell counts, determinations of red blood cell index values,
              and flow cytometric analyses of mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Fetal
              red blood cell, white blood cell, and platelet counts all
              increased with gestation, reflecting hematologic development. The
              proportion of normoblasts decreased dramatically with gestation.
              Individual mature red blood cells were larger and contained more
              hemoglobin during early gestation. Circulating and hepatic T
              lymphocytes increased in number shortly before the 13th week of
              gestation, which reflected thymic maturation. As a proportion
              fetal liver contained fewer T lymphocytes than did fetal blood
              (2.5\% vs 18.6\%; P =.003) but more CD34(+) hematopoietic stem
              and progenitor cells (17.5\% vs 4.3\%; P =. 004). As a
              proportion, fetal liver contained more of the primitive CD34(+)
              and CD38(-) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells than did
              fetal blood (32\% vs 17\%; P =.04). CONCLUSION: Both fetal blood
              and liver provide a rich source of hematopoietic stem and
              progenitor cells. Fetal liver provides a richer source of more
              primitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells than does fetal
              blood. For stem cell transplantation we suggest that fetal livers
              be collected before the 13th week of gestation, because T
              lymphocytes are present in much greater numbers in the fetal
              liver after this stage of gestation. Further, we suggest that in
              utero stem cell transplantations in fetuses with normal immune
              development should be performed before the 13th week of
              gestation.",

              mechanisms is needed to improve current immunotherapies. Our
              previous work has identified a novel ligand/receptor pair,
              LLT1/CD161, that modulates immune responses. Here, we extensively
              characterize its expression in non-small cell lung cancer
              (NSCLC). We show that LLT1 expression is restricted to germinal
              center (GC) B cells within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS),
              representing a new hallmark of the presence of active TLS in the
              tumor microenvironment. CD161-expressing immune cells are found
              at the vicinity of these structures, with a global enrichment of
              NSCLC tumors in CD161+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as compared to
              normal distant lung and peripheral blood. CD161+ CD4+ T cells are
              more activated and produce Th1-cytokines at a higher frequency

              CD161+ CD4+ T cells highly express OX40 co-stimulatory receptor,
              less frequently 4-1BB, and display an activated but not
              completely exhausted PD-1-positive Tim-3-negative phenotype.
              Finally, a meta-analysis revealed a positive association of
              CLEC2D (coding for LLT1) and KLRB1 (coding for CD161) gene
              expression with favorable outcome in NSCLC, independently of the

              a positive impact of LLT1/CD161 on NSCLC patient survival, and

              of CD161high CD8+ T cells declined. Although CD161high CD8+ T

              both young and old subjects. In essence, CD161-expressing T cells
              showed a similar memory phenotype in young and old subjects. The
              expression of the inhibitory NK receptor KLRG1 was decreased on

              other NK receptors by CD161-expressing T cells was unaltered with
              age. The expression of cytotoxic effector molecules was similar
              in CD161high and CD161int CD8+ T cells of young and old subjects.
              The ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines was preserved
              in CD161high and CD161int CD8+ T cells of old subjects. However,
              the percentages of IFN-$\gamma$+ and interleukin-17+ cells were
              significantly lower in CD161+ CD4+ T cells of old individuals

              indicated by decreased percentages of CD161-expressing cells
              within the IFN-$\gamma$+ CD4+ T cell compartment of old subjects.
              Taken together, aging is associated with a numerical decline of
              circulating CD161high CD8+ T cells, as well as a decreased
              production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by CD161+ CD4+ T cells.

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Fetal cell microchimerism (FCM) is defined as the
              persistence of fetal cells in the mother for decades after
              pregnancy without any apparent rejection. Fetal microchimeric
              cells (fmcs) engraft the maternal bone marrow and are able to
              migrate through the circulation and to reach tissues. In
              malignancies, the possible role of fmcs is still controversial,
              several studies advising a protective and repairing function, and
              other postulating a beneficial role in the progression of the
              disease. At the peripheral blood level, FCM is less frequently
              observed in women with several solid and hematological neoplasia
              with respect to healthy controls, suggesting a beneficial role in
              cancer surveillance. At the tissue level, fmcs were documented in
              neoplastic lesions of thyroid, breast, cervix, lung and melanoma,
              displaying epithelial, hematopoietic, mesenchymal and endothelial
              lineage differentiation. Fmcs expressing hematopoietic markers
              were hypothesized to have a role in the attack to neoplastic
              cells, whereas those expressing epithelial or mesenchymal
              antigens could be involved in repair and replacement of damaged
              cells. On the other hand, fetal cells showing an endothelial
              phenotype could have a role in tumor evolution and progression.
              The positive effect of FCM is supported by findings in animal
              models. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides an extensive overview
              of the link between fetal cell microchimerism and maternal
              cancers. Moreover, biological mechanisms by which fetal cell
              microchimerism is believed to modulate the protection against
              cancer development or tumor progression will be discussed,

              mechanism of how this occurs is an area of intense study, as it
              may lead to new cancer treatments. The leading theory is that
              microchimeric cells perform immune surveillance by directly
              fighting cancerous cells and that they also act as stem cells,
              repairing damaged tissue (Khosrotehrani et al. in JAMA 292:75-80,
              2004). However, there is conflicting evidence to support this
              theory. Several small studies have found few microchimeric cells
              in tumor tissue (Gadi in Breast Cancer Res Treat 121(1):241-244,
              2010; Cirello et al. in Int J Cancer 126:2874-2878, 2010), while
              another study contradicted these findings by showing
              microchimeric cells clustered around tumor tissue (O'Donoghue et
              al. in Reprod Biomed Online 16:382-390, 2008). To date, we have
              designed the largest and broadest study to investigate this
              question of whether microchimeric cells really do cluster at
              tumor tissue. We analyzed 245 samples from a broad range of
              cancer types. Using PCR for the male chromosome marker TSPY1, we
              identified only 12 out of 245 samples with microchimerism for a
              rate of 4.9\% (95\% confidence interval 2.2-7.6\%). Five of these
              samples were confirmed using Y fluorescence in situ
              hybridization. This rate of 4.9\% microchimerism is the lowest
              reported in any study. The low percentage of microchimerism
              observed in our broad study suggests that microchimeric cells do
              not invade tumors to fight off neoplasm.",

              There has been extensive research on how the immunity,

              University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
              Center, USA. POPULATION: Women delivering singleton pregnancies
              without pertinent antenatal complications with uncomplicated
              deliveries (n = 36). METHODS: We collected maternal predelivery,
              postdelivery and umbilical cord blood for each mother-baby pair.
              Following maternal and fetal genotyping, FMc was measured with
              quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays targeting
              fetus-specific polymorphisms. Quantification of FMc is expressed
              as genome equivalents (gEq) of fetal DNA/100 000 total gEq
              tested. FMc detection was evaluated by logistic regression while
              controlling for total number of cell equivalents tested and
              clinically relevant covariates. FMc concentrations were compared
              using negative binomial regression while controlling for the same
              covariates and predelivery FMc positivity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:
              Detection and concentration of FMc by mode of delivery. RESULTS:
              Twenty-four mother-baby pairs had a VD and 12 had a CD.
              Postdelivery FMc detection was higher following CD than after VD
              (58.3\% versus 16.7\%, P = 0.02). After controlling for
              covariates, the likelihood of postdelivery FMc detection was
              almost nine-fold higher after CD than VD (odds ratio 8.8, 95\% CI
              1.6-47.6; P = 0.01). With respect to postdelivery FMc
              concentration, the detection rate ratio for CD versus VD in the
              adjusted negative binomial regression model was 14.7 (95\% CI
              3.2-66.8; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Postdelivery peripheral FMc
              detection and concentration are significantly higher after CD
              than after VD. As FMc is associated with long-term maternal
              health, our findings suggest that the mode of delivery may impact

              complications of pregnancy, such as preeclampsia, as well as
              insights into the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases which
              usually ameliorate during pregnancy. The impact of the
              persistence of allogenic cells of fetal origin and of the
              maternal immunological response to them on the mother's health is
              still not clear. On the beneficial side, it has been proposed
              that genetically disparate fetal microchimerism provides
              protection against some cancers, that fetal microchimerism can
              afford the mother new mechanisms of protection to some diseases,
              that fetal microchimerism can enlarge the immunological
              repertoire of the mother improving her defense against aggressor.
              Fetal cells are often present at sites of maternal injury and may
              have an active role in the repair of maternal tissues.",

              This observational study aims to show the short term and the long

              that were on average 18 months postpartum. The short term effects

              CD4+ memory cell proportions in primigravid women compared to
              nulligravid women. The persistent effects found in this study

              be categorized into 2 subtypes according to the mechanism of
              generation. Neutrophil-derived trails (NDTRs) are generated from
              migrating neutrophils. The uropods of neutrophils are elongated
              by adhesion to endothelial cells, and small parts of the uropods
              are detached, leaving submicrometer-sized NDTRs.
              Neutrophil-derived microvesicles (NDMVs) are generated from
              neutrophils which arrived at the inflammatory foci. Membrane
              blebbing occurs in response to various stimuli at the
              inflammatory foci, and small parts of the blebs are detached from
              the neutrophils, leaving NDMVs. These 2 subtypes of

              NDTRs exert pro-inflammatory functions by guiding subsequent

              NDMVs exert anti-inflammatory functions by limiting the excessive

              Such T cells were predominantly CD27lo/- effector lymphocytes,
              whereas na{\"\i}ve CD27hi, TCR-diverse populations present in
              matched blood were generally absent in the liver. Furthermore,
              while a CD45RAhi V$\delta$2- $\gamma$$\delta$ effector subset
              present in both liver and peripheral blood contained overlapping
              TCR clonotypes, the liver V$\delta$2- $\gamma$$\delta$ T cell
              pool also included a phenotypically distinct CD45RAlo effector
              compartment that was enriched for expression of the tissue
              tropism marker CD69, the hepatic homing chemokine receptors CXCR3
              and CXCR6, and liver-restricted TCR clonotypes, suggestive of
              intrahepatic tissue residency. Liver infiltrating V$\delta$2-
              $\gamma$$\delta$ cells were capable of polyfunctional cytokine
              secretion, and unlike peripheral blood subsets, were responsive
              to both TCR and innate stimuli. CONCLUSION: These findings
              suggest that the ability of V$\delta$2- $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells
              to undergo clonotypic expansion and differentiation is crucial in
              permitting access to solid tissues, such as the liver, which
              results in functionally distinct peripheral and liver-resident
              memory $\gamma$$\delta$ T cell subsets. They also highlight the
              inherent functional plasticity within the V$\delta$2-
              $\gamma$$\delta$ T cell compartment and provide information that
              could be used for the design of cellular therapies that suppress
              liver inflammation or combat liver cancer. LAY SUMMARY:
              $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells are frequently enriched in many solid
              tissues, however the immunobiology of such tissue-associated
              subsets in humans has remained unclear. We show that intrahepatic
              $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells are enriched for clonally expanded
              effector T cells, whereas na{\"\i}ve $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells are
              largely excluded. Moreover, whereas a distinct proportion of
              circulating T cell clonotypes was present in both the liver
              tissue and peripheral blood, a functionally and clonotypically
              distinct population of liver-resident $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells
              was also evident. Our findings suggest that factors triggering
              $\gamma$$\delta$ T cell clonal selection and differentiation,
              such as infection, can drive enrichment of $\gamma$$\delta$ T
              cells into liver tissue, allowing the development of functionally
              distinct tissue-restricted memory populations specialised in
              local hepatic immunosurveillance.",

              Recent reports have suggested that $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells can
              have memory analogous to conventional $\alpha$$\beta$ T cells. In
              this study we have examined the role of $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells

              $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells, predominantly V$\gamma$4-$\gamma$1-
              cells, produced IL-17 in the lungs as early as 2 h after
              infection. The bacterial burden during primary infection was
              significantly enhanced and the induction of antimicrobial
              peptides was reduced in the absence of early IL-17. A second peak
              of $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells is detected in the lungs 7-14 d after
              challenge and these $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells were pathogen
              specific. $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells, exclusively V$\gamma$4, from
              the lungs of infected but not naive mice produced IL-17 in
              response to heat-killed B. pertussis in the presence of APC.
              Furthermore, $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells from the lungs of mice
              reinfected with B. pertussis produced significantly more IL-17

              $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells with a tissue resident memory T cell

              The $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells from skin-draining LNs utilized
              compensatory T cell-intrinsic TLR2/MyD88 signaling to mediate
              rescue by trafficking and producing TNF and IFN-$\gamma$, which
              restored neutrophil recruitment and promoted bacterial clearance.

              arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Although a principal effector
              of T helper type 17 cells, IL-17A is produced by many other cell

              is found at high levels associated with mast cells and
              neutrophils at sites of skin and joint disease in humans. IL-17A
              up-regulates expression of numerous inflammation-related genes in
              target cells such as keratinocytes and fibroblasts, leading to
              increased production of chemokines, cytokines, antimicrobial
              peptides and other mediators that contribute to clinical disease
              features. Importantly, IL-17A must be considered within the
              context of the local microenvironment, because it acts
              synergistically or additively with other pro-inflammatory
              cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor. Several direct
              IL-17A inhibitors have shown promising activity in proof of

              CD4+ T cell repertoire analysis of highly purified T cell
              populations from naive animals revealed that the HEL-specific

              paradigm for CD4+ T cell maturation in which a specific clone can
              undergo a differentiation process to exhibit a ``memory'' or
              regulatory phenotype without having undergone a clonal expansion

              Acquired resistance to immune checkpoint therapy is being
              recognized more commonly. This work demonstrates for the first
              time that acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade can
              arise in association with the evolving landscape of mutations,
              some of which encode tumor neoantigens recognizable by T cells.
              These observations imply that widening the breadth of neoantigen
              reactivity may mitigate the development of acquired resistance.

              survival by which cells clear damaged organelles and recycle
              nutrients when homeostasis is maintained. Cancer is a complex
              disease with uncontrolled growth of cancer cells. Recent studies
              have suggested the role of autophagy in cancer. A complex
              relationship exists between autophagy and cancer, since autophagy
              can contribute to the survival or the destruction of malignant
              cells depending on the stage of tumor development. In this
              review, we describe in detail the mechanism underlying autophagy
              in cancer cells and the intricate involvement of the programmed
              cell death-1 (PD1) receptor with its ligand (PD-L1). The
              overexpression of PD-L1 receptors on cancer cell membranes has
              been observed in several types of cancers. The interaction of
              PD-L1 on cancer cells with PD1 on the surface of T-cells causes
              cancer cells to escape from the immune system by preventing the
              activation of new cytotoxic T-cells in the lymph nodes and
              subsequent recruitment to the tumor. In addition to its
              immunopathogenicity, PD1 has been related to autophagy. Reduction
              of this receptor due to treatment increases autophagy, therefore
              promoting the recycling of nutrients and clearance of toxic
              species, consequently promoting cell survival. In addition,
              PD-L1/PD1 engagement can induce autophagy in nearby T-cells due
              to a decrease in the amino acids tryptophan and arginine and due
              to the deprivation of nutrients such as glucose followed by a
              reduction in glucose metabolism. Resistance to cancer therapies
              is attributed to various pathways in oncogenesis including,
              inhibition of tumor suppressors, alteration of the tumor
              metabolic environment, and upregulation of autophagy. Here we
              explore the interaction between the immunosuppressive PD-L1/PD1
              engagement and autophagy mechanisms, and evaluate the impact of
              inhibition of these pathways in augmenting antitumor efficacy.",

              becomes able to escape from immune system control by using
              multiple mechanisms, which are only in part known at a cellular
              and molecular level. Among these mechanisms, in the last decade,
              the role played by the so-called ``inhibitory immune
              checkpoints'' is emerging as pivotal in preventing the tumor
              attack by the immune system. Physiologically, the inhibitory
              immune checkpoints work to maintain the self-tolerance and
              attenuate the tissue injury caused by pathogenic infections.
              Cancer cell exploits such immune-inhibitory molecules to contrast
              the immune intervention and induce tumor tolerance. Molecular
              agents that target these checkpoints represent the new frontier

              receptors such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 and thus unleash
              antigen-specific immune responses against tumors. It is clear
              that tumors evade the immune response by usurping pathways that
              play a role in negatively regulating normal immune responses. In
              this regard, adenosine in the immune microenvironment leading to
              the activation of the A2a receptor has been shown to represent
              one such negative feedback loop. Indeed, the tumor

              and immunoediting. Several regulatory pathways, typically
              involved in immune cell homeostasis, are co-opted by cancer cells
              to thwart the development of effective antitumor responses. These
              regulatory circuits include the engagement of inhibitory
              checkpoint pathways (CTLA-4, PD-1/PD-L1, LAG-3 and TIM-3),
              secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (TGF-$\beta$, IL-10),

              modalities, which have already generated clinical benefits in an
              important number of cancer patients. Galectins, a family of

  abstract = "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the major cause of
              inflammatory liver disease, of which the clinical recovery and
              effective anti-viral therapy is associated with the sustained
              viral control of effector T cells. In humans, chronic HBV
              infection often shows weak or absent virus-specific T-cell
              reactivity, which is described as the 'exhaustion' state
              characterized by poor effector cytotoxic activity, impaired
              cytokine production and sustained expression of multiple
              inhibitory receptors, such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1),
              lymphocyte activation gene-3, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated
              antigen-4 and CD244. As both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells
              participate in the immune responses against chronic hepatitis
              virus through distinct manners, compelling evidences have been
              proposed, which restore the anti-viral function of these
              exhausted T cells by blocking those inhibitory receptors with its
              ligand and will pave the way for the development of more
              effective immunotherapeutic and prophylactic strategies for the
              treatment of chronic infectious diseases. A large number of
              studies have stated the essentiality of T-cell exhaustion in
              virus-infected diseases, such as LCMV, hepatitis C virus (HCV),
              human immunodeficiency virus infections and cancers. Besides, the
              functional restoration of HCV- and HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells by
              PD-1 blockade has already been repeatedly verified, and also for
              the immunological control of tumors in humans, blocking the PD-1
              pathway could be a major immunotherapeutic strategy. Although the
              specific molecular pathways of T-cell exhaustion remain
              ambiguous, several transcriptional pathways have been implicated
              in T-cell exhaustion recently; among them Blimp-1, T-bet and
              NFAT2 were able to regulate exhausted T cells during chronic
              viral infection, suggesting a distinct lineage fate for this
              sub-population of T cells. This paper summarizes the current

              checkpoint receptor expressed on activated/exhausted T cells.
              When engaged by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class

              contributing to tumor escape. Intriguingly, a soluble LAG3
              variant activates both immune and malignant MHC class
              II-presenting cells. In the study herein, we examined the role of
              LAG3 in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, an MHC
              class II-presenting malignancy, and show that chronic lymphocytic
              leukemia cells express and secrete LAG3. High levels of surface
              and soluble LAG3 were associated with the unmutated
              immunoglobulin variable heavy chain leukemic subtype and a
              shorter median time from diagnosis to first treatment. Utilizing
              a mechanism mediated through MHC class II engagement, recombinant

              by SYK, BTK and MAPK signaling. Moreover, LAG3 blocking antibody
              enhanced in vitro T-cell activation. Our data suggest that
              soluble LAG3 promotes leukemic cell activation and anti-apoptotic
              effects through its engagement with MHC class II. Furthermore,
              MHC class II-presenting chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells may
              affect LAG3-presenting T cells and impose immune exhaustion on
              their microenvironment; hence, blocking LAG3-MHC class II

              phosphatase, and the links between PTEN+ Tregs and the
              immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). IDO
              has received attention because it can be expressed by a variety

              immune cells of both humans and mice in response to inflammation,

              immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To date, however, they
              have been difficult to target for therapy. One emerging new
              aspect of Treg biology is their apparent functional instability
              in the face of certain acute proinflammatory signals such as IL6
              and IFN$\gamma$. Under the right conditions, these signals can
              cause a rapid loss of suppressor activity and reprogramming of
              the Tregs into a proinflammatory phenotype. In this review, we
              propose the hypothesis that this phenotypic modulation does not
              reflect infidelity to the Treg lineage, but rather represents a
              natural, physiologic response of Tregs during beneficial
              inflammation. In tumors, however, this inflammation-induced Treg
              destabilization is actively opposed by dominant stabilizing
              factors such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and the PTEN

              tumor-associated Tregs remain highly suppressive and inhibit

              unappreciated mechanisms of resistance exist. The tumor
              microenvironment (TME) is unique and composed of many suppressive
              cell populations that inhibit antitumor immune responses,
              including regulatory T cells (Tregs). The TME is nutrient poor,
              acidic, and hypoxic, creating a challenging microenvironment for
              immune cells to function and survive. Tregs suppress a wide
              variety of cell populations through multiple mechanisms and are
              tasked with limiting tissue damage. Tregs are now considered to
              be a barrier to effective antitumor immunity. Systemic Treg
              depletion is not favored because of their critical role in
              maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity.
              Reducing Treg function specifically within the TME may provide a
              more effective, targeted approach to limit the immunosuppressive
              environment within the tumor without inducing systemic adverse
              consequences. Targeting molecules that cause Treg instability,
              characterized by loss of critical Treg transcription factors such
              as Foxp3, could result in conversion into cells that cause immune
              pathology, tissue damage, and subsequent autoimmune side effects.
              Interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN$\gamma$) can cause intratumoral Treg
              ``fragility,'' which results in loss of suppressive activity and
              increased IFN$\gamma$ production without loss of Foxp3 expression
              and gross Treg ``identity.'' We reviewed the impact Tregs have on
              the TME and vice versa, and their implications for responsiveness
              to cancer immunotherapy. We propose that the extent to which
              intratumoral Tregs develop a ``fragile'' phenotype following
              immunotherapy will predict and dictate responsiveness. Cancer

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors, like anti-PD-1/PD-L1
              antibodies, are revolutionizing therapeutic concepts in the
              treatment of cancer. Said class of drugs will represent a
              multi-billion dollar market over the coming decade. Many
              companies have therefore developed important patent activities in
              the field. AREAS COVERED: The present review gives an overview of
              the patent literature during the period 2010-2015 in the field of
              immune checkpoint inhibitors. In particular, the review presents
              a selection of international patent applications related to
              inhibitors of PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4, IDO, TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT, BTLA,
              VISTA, ICOS, KIRs and CD39. EXPERT OPINION: Immune checkpoint
              inhibitors are now widely accepted as a key component of the
              therapeutic strategies in cancer. This fervent activity creates a
              maze of third-party patents that pose considerable risks for both
              newcomers and established companies. We can thus anticipate that
              the number of patent conflicts and disputes will increase in the
              near future. Treatments will involve combination therapy
              comprising at least one immune checkpoint inhibitor and companies
              will multiply patent filings in this field. Finally, we can
              expect that patents related to biomarkers that will render a

              to targeting alternative inhibitory receptors (IRs) and
              suppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment.
              Lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG3) (CD223) is the third IR to be
              targeted in the clinic, consequently garnering considerable
              interest and scrutiny. LAG3 upregulation is required to control
              overt activation and prevent the onset of autoimmunity. However,
              persistent antigen exposure in the tumor microenvironment results

              immune tolerance. Tregs are divided into two major populations:
              one is thymus derived and the other develops in the periphery.
              Among these Tregs, CD4+CD25+ Tregs, which mainly originate in the
              thymus, have been extensively studied. Transcription factor Foxp3
              is well known as a master regulatory gene for the development and
              function of CD4+CD25+ Tregs. On the other hand, peripheral Tregs
              consist of distinct cell subsets including Foxp3-dependent
              extrathymically developed Tregs and interleukin (IL)-10-producing
              type I regulatory T (Tr1) cells. Lymphocyte activation gene 3
              (LAG3) and CD49b are reliable cell surface markers for Tr1 cells.
              CD4+CD25-LAG3+ Tregs (LAG3+ Tregs) develop in the periphery and
              produce a large amount of IL-10. LAG3+ Tregs characteristically
              express the early growth response gene 2 (Egr2), a zinc-finger
              transcription factor, and exhibit its suppressive activity in a
              Foxp3-independent manner. Although Egr2 was known to be essential
              for hindbrain development and myelination of the peripheral
              nervous system, recent studies revealed that Egr2 plays vital
              roles in the induction of T cell anergy and also the suppressive
              activities of LAG3+ Tregs. Intriguingly, forced expression of
              Egr2 converts naive CD4+ T cells into IL-10-producing Tregs that
              highly express LAG3. Among the four Egr gene family members, Egr3
              is thought to compensate for the function of Egr2. Recently, we
              reported that LAG3+ Tregs suppress humoral immune responses via
              transforming growth factor $\beta$3 production in an Egr2- and
              Egr3-dependent manner. In this review, we focus on the role of

              characterized by autoantibodies directed against nuclear
              autoantigens normally concealed from immune recognition in
              healthy individuals. Here, we summarize recently identified
              mechanisms of abnormal cell death leading to exposure and
              aberrant processing of nucleoprotein self antigens, and discuss
              their role in the SLE pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: During the
              past few years, the unveiling of several new forms of cell death
              has expanded our understanding beyond the simple view of
              'apoptotic' versus 'necrotic' cell death. SLE patients show
              abnormalities in cell death at several levels, including
              increased rates of apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, as well as
              reduced clearance of dying cells. These abnormalities lead to an
              increased autoantigen burden and antigen modifications, such as
              nucleic acid oxidation that increases the inflammatory properties
              of self antigens. Recent investigations have highlighted the role
              of opsonins in determining the immunogenic versus tolerogenic
              characteristics of self antigens. SUMMARY: Dysregulation of
              different forms of programmed cell death contributes to increased

              release: P = 0.0001). Importantly, cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific
              responses were not found significantly altered in SLE patients.
              Furthermore, we demonstrate that EBV-specific CD8+ T cell
              impairment is a consequence of their Programmed Death 1 (PD-1)
              receptor up-regulation, as blocking this pathway reverses the
              dysfunctional phenotype. Finally, prospective monitoring of lupus
              patients revealed that disease flares precede EBV reactivation.
              In conclusion, EBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses in SLE patients
              are functionally impaired, but EBV reactivation appears to be an
              aggravating consequence rather than a cause of SLE
              immunopathology. We therefore propose that autoimmune B cell
              activation during flares drives frequent EBV reactivation, which
              contributes in a vicious circle to the perpetuation of immune
              activation in SLE patients.",

  abstract = "The etiology of SLE is not fully established. SLE is a disease
              with periods of waning disease activity and intermittent flares.
              This fits well in theory to a latent virus infection, which
              occasionally switches to lytic cycle, and EBV infection has for
              long been suspected to be involved. This paper reviews EBV
              immunobiology and how this is related to SLE pathogenesis by
              illustrating uncontrolled reactivation of EBV as a disease
              mechanism for SLE. Studies on EBV in SLE patients show enlarged
              viral load, abnormal expression of viral lytic genes, impaired
              EBV-specific T-cell response, and increased levels of
              EBV-directed antibodies. These results suggest a role for
              reactivation of EBV infection in SLE. The increased level of EBV
              antibodies especially comprises an elevated titre of IgA
              antibodies, and the total number of EBV-reacting antibody
              isotypes is also enlarged. As EBV is known to be controlled by
              cell-mediated immunity, the reduced EBV-specific T-cell response
              in SLE patients may result in defective control of EBV causing
              frequent reactivation and expression of lytic cycle antigens.
              This gives rise to enhanced apoptosis and amplified cellular
              waste load resulting in activation of an immune response and
              development of EBV-directed antibodies and autoantibodies to

              However, tumors and their immunosuppressive microenvironments

              inhibitors yielded unprecedented efficacies and durable responses

              conventional radiotherapy regimens. Neverthless, many clinical
              problems remain in terms of efficacy, patient-to-patient
              variability, and undesirable outcomes and side effects. In this
              review, we evaluate recent advances in the immuno-oncology field
              and discuss ways forward. First, we give an overview of current
              immunotherapy modalities, involving mainy single agents,
              including inhibitor monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting T-cell
              checkpoints of PD-1 and CTLA-4. However, neoantigen recognition
              alone cannot eliminate tumors effectively in vivo given their
              inherent complex micro-environment, heterogeneous nature and
              stemness. Then, based mainly upon CTLA-4 and PD-1 checkpoint
              inhibitors as a ``backbone,'' we cover a range of emerging
              (``second-generation'') therapies incorporating other
              immunotherapies or non-immune based strategies in synergistic
              combination. These include targeted therapies such as tyrosine
              kinase inhibitors, co-stimulatory mAbs, bifunctional agents,
              epigenetic modulators (such as inhibitors of histone deacetylases
              or DNA methyltransferase), vaccines, adoptive-T-cell therapy,
              nanoparticles, oncolytic viruses, and even synthetic ``gene

              pre-clinical development are also introduced. The latter include
              metabolic components, exosomes and ion channels. We discuss in
              some detail of the personalization of immunotherapy essential for

              models, MVA-BN-HER2 poxvirus immunotherapy resulted in
              significant tumor growth delay accompanied by a robust,
              tumor-infiltrating T cell response that was characterized by low
              to mid-levels of PD-1 expression on T cells. As hypothesized,

              when MVA-BN-HER2 immunotherapy was combined with PD-1 immune

              evaluated in numerous studies at both pre-clinical and clinical
              levels and the recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval
              of an oncolytic herpesvirus-based treatment raises optimism that
              OVs will become a therapeutic option for cancer patients.
              However, to improve clinical outcome, there is a need to increase
              OV efficacy. In addition to killing cancer cells directly through
              lysis, OVs can stimulate the induction of anti-tumour immune
              responses. The host immune system thus represents a
              ``double-edged sword'' for oncolytic virotherapy: on the one
              hand, a robust anti-viral response will limit OV replication and
              spread; on the other hand, the immune-mediated component of OV
              therapy may be its most important anti-cancer mechanism. Although
              the relative contribution of direct viral oncolysis and indirect,
              immune-mediated oncosuppression to overall OV efficacy is
              unclear, it is likely that an initial period of vigorous OV
              multiplication and lytic activity will most optimally set the

              the negative impact of innate immunity on the direct oncolytic

              potentiating OV-elicited anti-tumour immunity through the
              blockade of immune checkpoints. We conclude by proposing a
              two-phase combinatorial strategy in which initial OV replication
              and spread is maximised through transient HDAC inhibition, with
              anti-tumour immune responses subsequently enhanced by immune

              non-histone protein. HMGB1, which is secreted by inflammatory
              cells and passively released from apoptotic and necrotic cells,
              may act as a pro-inflammatory mediator. As apoptotic cells
              accumulate in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), HMGB1 levels
              might be increased in SLE. HMGB1 may also serve as an
              autoantigen, leading to the production of anti-HMGB1 antibodies.
              In this study we determined levels of HMGB1 and anti-HMGB1 in SLE
              patients in comparison to healthy controls (HC) and analysed
              their relation with disease activity. METHODS: The study
              population consisted of 70 SLE patients and 35 age- and
              sex-matched HC. Thirty-three SLE patients had quiescent disease,
              the other 37 patients were selected for having active disease.
              Nineteen of these had lupus nephritis. HMGB1 levels were measured
              with both Western blot and ELISA. Anti-HMGB1 levels were measured
              by ELISA. Clinical and serological parameters were assessed
              according to routine procedures. RESULTS: HMGB1 levels in SLE
              patients could be measured reliably by Western blotting only, and
              were significantly increased compared to HC. During active
              disease HMGB1 levels increased, in particular in patients with
              renal involvement. Serum HMGB1 levels correlated with SLEDAI,
              proteinuria, and anti-dsDNA levels, and showed a negative
              correlation with complement C3. Anti-HMGB1 levels were
              significantly increased in SLE patients compared to HC, and
              positively correlated with HMGB1 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of
              HMGB1 in the sera of SLE patients, in particular in those with
              active renal disease, are increased. Serum HMGB1 levels are
              related to SLEDAI scores and proteinuria, as well as to levels of
              anti-HMGB1 antibodies. These findings suggest that besides HMGB1,

              levels. The IFN score was increased in all RA groups (VERA,
              bDMARD-na{\"\i}ve, and bDMARD), but important differences in
              their degree of activation and in the relationships among IRGs
              were observed. The IFN score correlated with the accumulated
              disease activity score 28-joints, and it was found to be a
              predictor of clinical outcome in VERA. No differences in the IFN
              score were observed between the bDMARD-naive and bDMARD groups,
              but opposite associations with the clinical parameters were
              noted. Interestingly, the correlations among IRGs delineate
              different pictures between these two groups. The IFN score at
              baseline predicted poor clinical outcome upon TNF$\alpha$
              blockade. Although no absolute changes in the IFN score were
              found, TNF$\alpha$-blockade shifted the associations among IRGs.
              Conclusion: A certain heterogeneity within the IFN signature can
              be recognized in RA, depending on the clinical stage. The
              structure of the IFN signature may be a potential explanation for
              the controversy in this field and must be considered to decipher
              its clinical relevancein RA.",

              inflammation in several organs including kidneys, skin, joints,
              blood and nervous system. Abnormal immune cellular and humoral
              responses play important roles in the development of the disease
              process. Impaired clearance of apoptotic material is a key factor
              contributing to the activation of self-reactive immune cells. The
              incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is
              increased up to 50-fold in patients with SLE compared to age- and
              gender-matched controls, and this can only partly be explained by
              traditional risk factors for CVD. Currently, there is no
              effective treatment to prevent CVD complications in SLE.
              Traditional preventive CVD therapies have not been found to
              significantly lower the incidence of CVD in SLE; therefore, there
              is a need for novel treatment strategies and increased

              CVD complications in SLE. The pathogenic immune responses in SLE

              non-HLA polymorphisms to the complex genetics of SLE are
              reviewed. We also review recent reports of specific gene deficits
              leading to monogenic SLE-like syndromes. The molecular functions
              of common SLE-risk variants are reviewed in depth, including
              regulatory variations in promoter and enhancer elements and
              coding-change polymorphisms, and studies which are beginning to
              define the molecular and cellular functions of these

              program is described for several autoimmune diseases, including
              systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS),
              myositis (IIM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While IFN$\alpha$
              contributes to SLE pathology, IFN$\beta$ therapy is often
              beneficial in MS, implying different immunoregulatory roles for
              these IFNs. This study was aimed to investigate potential
              diversification of IFN$\alpha$-and IFN$\beta$-mediated response
              programs in autoimmune diseases. METHODS: Peripheral blood gene
              expression of 23 prototypical type I IFN response genes (IRGs)
              was determined in 54 healthy controls (HCs), 69 SLE (47 test, 22
              validation), 149 IFN$\beta$-treated MS (71 test, 78 validation),
              160 untreated MS, 78 IIM and 76 RA patients. Patients with a type
              I IFN signature were selected for analysis. RESULTS: We
              identified IFN$\alpha$- and IFN$\beta$-specific response programs
              (GC-A and GC-B, respectively) in SLE and IFN$\beta$-treated MS
              patients. Concordantly, the GC-A/GC-B log-ratio was positive for
              all SLE patients and negative for virtually all
              IFN$\beta$-treated MS patients, which was confirmed in additional
              cohorts. Applying this information to other autoimmune diseases,
              IIM patients displayed positive GC-A/GC-B log-ratios, indicating
              predominant IFN$\alpha$ activity. The GC-A/GC-B log-ratio in RA
              was lower and approached zero in part of the patients, implying
              relative importance of both clusters. Remarkably, GC-A/GC-B
              log-ratios appeared most heterogeneous in untreated MS; half of
              the patients displayed GC-A dominance, whereas others showed GC-B
              dominance or log-ratios near zero. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show
              diversification of the type I IFN response in autoimmune
              diseases, suggesting different pathogenic roles of the type I

              (MPs-ICs). The number of MPs and MPs-ICs increases in patients
              with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). MPs activate myeloid
              cells by inducing IL-6 and TNF-$\alpha$ in both SLE and other
              diseases. Therefore, we propose that the recognition of MPs-ICs
              by monocytes rather that MPs may define their phenotype and
              contribute to the inflammatory process in patients with SLE.
              Thus, the aims of this study were to evaluate the association
              among circulating MPs-ICs from different cell sources,
              alterations observed in monocyte subsets, and disease activity in
              patients with SLE and to establish whether monocytes bind and
              respond to MPs-ICs in vitro. Circulating MPs and monocyte subsets
              were characterized in 60 patients with SLE and 60 healthy
              controls (HCs) using multiparametric flow cytometry. Patients had
              higher MP counts and frequencies of MPs-CD41a +
              (platelet-derived) compared with HCs, regardless of disease
              activity. MPs from patients with SLE were C1q + and formed ICs
              with IgM and IgG. MPs-IgG + were positively correlated with
              active SLE (aSLE), whereas MPs-IgM + were negatively correlated.
              Most of the circulating total ICs-IgG + were located on MPs. The
              proportion and number of non-classical monocytes were
              significantly decreased in patients with SLE compared with HCs
              and in patients with aSLE compared with patients with the
              inactive disease. Non-classical monocytes obtained from patients
              with SLE exhibited increased levels of CD64 associated with
              MPs-IgG +, MPs-C1q +, total circulating ICs-IgG +, and disease
              activity. The direct effects of MPs and MPs-IgG + on monocytes
              were evaluated in cell culture. Monocytes from both HCs and
              patients bound to and internalized MPs and MPs-IgG + independent
              of CD64. These vesicles derived from platelets (PMPs), mainly
              PMPs-IgG +, activated monocytes in vitro and increased the
              expression of CD69, CD64, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as
              IL-1$\beta$, TNF-$\alpha$, and IFN-$\alpha$. Therefore, MPs are
              one of the most representative sources of the total amount of
              circulating ICs-IgG + in patients with SLE. MPs-IgG + are
              associated with SLE activity, and PMPs-IgG + stimulate monocytes,
              changing their phenotype and promoting pro-inflammatory responses
              related to disease activity.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune
              disease characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against
              nuclear components. Lupus nephritis (LN) is the major cause of
              morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE. Central to the
              pathogenesis of SLE is the accumulation of cellular waste,
              especially apoptotic microparticles (MPs), which stimulates
              diverse immune reactions including the formation of neutrophil
              extracellular traps (NETs). In this study, we investigated the
              content of MPs from SLE patients with and without (active) LN,
              their capacity to stimulate NET release, and assessed the
              molecular mechanisms underlying MP-induced NETosis. METHODS: MPs
              from SLE patients with biopsy-proven active LN, remissive LN,
              without LN, and healthy controls were characterized by flow
              cytometry. Isolated neutrophils were exposed to MPs derived from
              either patient plasma or apoptotic human umbilical vein
              endothelial cells, and NET release was quantified by
              immunofluorescence imaging, spectrofluorometry or an in-house
              developed NET ELISA. RESULTS: MPs from SLE patients with active
              LN contain higher levels of acetylated chromatin compared to MPs
              from those with remissive LN, without LN, or healthy controls.
              MPs enriched in hyperacetylated chromatin are more potent in
              inducing NETosis when compared to MPs containing moderate
              acetylated chromatin. The release of NETs in response to MPs
              occurs rapidly in a concentration-dependent manner and proceeds
              independent from the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
              CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that MPs containing acetylated
              chromatin drive ROS-independent NET release in SLE patients with
              active LN, which may lead to the glomerular deposition of NETs
              and subsequent NET-driven LN.",

              for the diagnosis of SLE in large cohort of patients. We
              confirmed the presence of apoptotically modified autoantigens on

              H3-K27-me3; H2A/H4 AcK8,12,16; and H2B-AcK12). Anti-SNEC AAb were
              measured in the serum of 155 patients with SLE, 89 normal healthy
              donors (NHD), and 169 patients with other autoimmune connective
              tissue diseases employing SNEC-based indirect enzyme-linked
              immunosorbent assay (SNEC ELISA). We compared the test
              performance of SNEC ELISA with the routine diagnostic tests dsDNA
              Farr radioimmunoassay (RIA) and nucleosome-based ELISA
              (anti-dsDNA-NcX-ELISA). SNEC ELISA distinguished patients with
              SLE with a specificity of 98.9\% and a sensitivity of 70.6\% from
              NHD clearly surpassing RIA and anti-dsDNA-NcX-ELISA. In contrast
              to the other tests, SNEC ELISA significantly discriminated
              patients with SLE from patients with rheumatoid arthritis,
              primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, spondyloarthropathy,
              psoriatic arthritis, and systemic sclerosis. A positive test
              result in SNEC ELISA significantly correlated with serological
              variables and reflected the uptake of opsonized SNEC by
              neutrophils. This stresses the relevance of SNECs in the
              pathogenesis of SLE. We conclude that SNEC ELISA allows for the
              sensitive detection of pathologically relevant AAb, enabling its
              diagnostic usage. A positive SNEC test reflects the opsonization
              of cell remnants by AAb, the neutrophil recruitment to tissues,
              and the enhancement of local and systemic inflammatory responses.",

              the development of autoimmunity in scleroderma. Investigating
              cancer risk in these biologically relevant subsets may provide an
              opportunity to develop personalised cancer screening guidelines.
              In this study, we examined cancer risk in distinct serologic and
              phenotypic scleroderma subsets and compared estimates with the
              general population. METHODS: Patients in the Johns Hopkins
              Scleroderma Center observational cohort were studied. Overall and
              site-specific cancer incidence was calculated in distinct
              autoantibody and scleroderma phenotypic subsets, and compared
              with the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry, a
              representative sample of the US population. RESULTS: 2383
              patients with scleroderma contributing 37 686 person-years were
              studied. 205 patients (8.6\%) had a diagnosis of cancer. Within 3
              years of scleroderma onset, cancer risk was increased in patients
              with RNA polymerase III autoantibodies (antipol; standardised
              incidence ratio (SIR) 2.84, 95\% CI 1.89 to 4.10) and those
              lacking centromere, topoisomerase-1 and pol antibodies (SIR 1.83,
              95\% CI 1.10 to 2.86). Among antipol-positive patients,
              cancer-specific risk may vary by scleroderma subtype; those with
              diffuse scleroderma had an increased breast cancer risk, whereas
              those with limited scleroderma had high lung cancer risk. In
              contrast, patients with anticentromere antibodies had a lower
              risk of cancer during follow-up (SIR 0.59, 95\% CI 0.44 to 0.76).
              CONCLUSIONS: Autoantibody specificity and disease subtype are
              biologically meaningful filters that may inform cancer risk

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease
              characterized by vasculopathy, autoimmunity, and widespread
              dermal and visceral fibrosis. This article summarizes the current
              knowledge about the potential contribution of platelets in the
              disease process and the rationale of targeting platelets as an
              adjunct treatment for SSc. METHODS: We performed an electronic
              search (Medline) using the keywords platelets, systemic
              sclerosis, autoimmunity, fibrosis, Raynaud, and pulmonary
              arterial hypertension. RESULTS: The link that connects
              vasculopathy, autoimmunity, and fibrosis in SSc remains obscure.
              Experimental data suggest that platelets are not solely cell
              fragments regulating hemostasis but they have a pleiotropic role
              in several biologic processes including immune regulation,
              vasculopathy, fibrosis, and all key features of SSc. Platelets
              interplay with the impaired endothelium, can interact with immune
              cells, and they are storages of bioactive molecules involved in
              tissue injury and remodeling. The potential role of platelets in
              the pathogenesis of SSc is further supported by experimental data
              in animal models of SSc. Platelet-derived serotonin represents a
              novel target in SSc and serotonin blockade is currently being
              tested in clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Platelets may be actively
              involved in the pathogenesis of SSc by activating immune
              responses and facilitating the fibrotic process. However,
              definite conclusions cannot be drawn until more data from both
              basic and clinical research are available.",

              METHODS: Serum from 505 Australian SSc patients were analyzed

              autoantibodies to centromere proteins CENP-A and CENP-B, RNA

              hierarchical clustering of the first 2 dimensions of a principal
              components analysis of quantitative autoantibody scores. Results
              were compared with detailed clinical data. RESULTS: A total of
              449 of the 505 patients were positive for at least 1 autoantibody
              by immunoblotting. Heatmap visualization of autoantibody scores,
              along with principal components analysis clustering, demonstrated
              strong, mutually exclusive relationships between CENP, RNAP III,
              and topo I. Five patient clusters were identified: CENP, RNAP III
              strong, RNAP III weak, topo I, and other. Clinical features
              associated with CENP, RNAP III, and topo I were consistent with
              previously published reports concerning limited cutaneous and
              diffuse cutaneous SSc. A novel finding was the statistical
              separation of RNAP III into 2 clusters. Patients in the RNAP III
              strong cluster had an increased risk of gastric antral vascular
              ectasia, but a lower risk of esophageal dysmotility. Patients in
              the other cluster were more likely to be male and to have a
              history of smoking and a history of malignancy, but were less
              likely to have telangiectasia, Raynaud's phenomenon, and joint

              abnormalities found at the level of tissues and cells, as well as
              by microenvironmental influences, such as reactive oxygen species
              (ROS), that alter intracellular metabolism and protein
              expression. Moreover, the convergence of genetic, epigenetic, and
              even environmental influences can result in B and T lymphocyte
              autoimmunity and tissue pathology. Recent Advances: This review
              describes how oxidative stress to cells and tissues may alter
              post-translational protein modifications, both directly and
              indirectly, as well as potentially lead to aberrant gene
              expression. For example, it has been clearly observed in many
              systems how oxidative stress directly amplifies carbonyl protein
              modifications. However, ROS also lead to a number of nonenzymatic
              spontaneous modifications including deamidation and isoaspartate
              modification as well as to enzyme-mediated citrullination of
              self-proteins. ROS have direct effects on DNA methylation,
              leading to influences in gene expression, chromosome
              inactivation, and the silencing of genetic elements. Finally, ROS
              can alter many other cellular pathways, including the initiation
              of apoptosis and NETosis, triggering the release of modified
              intracellular autoantigens. CRITICAL ISSUES: This review will
              detail specific post-translational protein modifications, the
              pathways that control autoimmunity to modified self-proteins, and
              how products of ROS may be important biomarkers of tissue
              pathogenesis. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: A clear understanding of the
              many pathways affected by ROS will lead to potential therapeutic
              manipulations to alter the onset and/or progression of autoimmune

              disordered regions would generally make poor B cell epitopes and

              type 4 (PAD4) is the target of a polyclonal group of
              autoantibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A
              subgroup of such antibodies, initially identified by
              cross-reactivity with peptidylarginine deiminase type 3 (PAD3),
              is strongly associated with progression of radiographic joint
              damage and interstitial lung disease and has the unique ability
              to activate PAD4. The features of these antibodies in terms of
              their T cell-dependent origin, genetic characteristics and effect
              of individual antibody specificities on PAD4 function remain to
              be defined. METHODS: We used PAD4 tagged with the monomeric
              fluorescent protein mWasabi to isolate PAD4-specific memory B
              cells from anti-PAD4 positive patients with RA and applied single
              cell cloning technologies to obtain monoclonal antibodies.
              RESULTS: Among 44 single B cells, we cloned five antibodies with
              PAD4-activating properties. Sequence analysis, germline reversion
              experiments and antigen specificity assays suggested that
              autoantibodies to PAD4 are not polyreactive and arise from
              PAD4-reactive precursors. Somatic mutations increase the
              agonistic activity of these antibodies at low calcium
              concentrations by facilitating their interaction with structural
              epitopes that modulate calcium-binding site 5 in PAD4.
              CONCLUSIONS: PAD4-activating antibodies directly amplify a key
              process in disease pathogenesis, making them unique among other
              autoantibodies in RA. Understanding the molecular basis for their

              mechanisms underlying their selection as immune targets.
              Initiation of autoimmune responses likely reflects the
              presentation of antigens with a distinct structure not previously
              encountered by the immune system, in a proimmune context (injury,
              malignancy, or infection). Causes of modified structure include
              somatic mutation and posttranslational modifications (including
              citrullination and proteolysis). Many autoantigens are components
              of multimolecular complexes, and some of the other components may
              provide adjuvant activity. Propagation of autoimmune responses
              appears to reflect a bidirectional interaction between the immune
              response and the target tissues in a mutually reinforcing cycle:
              Immune effector pathways generate additional autoantigen, which
              feeds further immune response. We propose that this resonance may
              be a critical principle underlying disease propagation, with
              specific autoantigens functioning as the hubs around which

              treating drug-resistant strands. Autoimmune diseases are a
              leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with a growing mass of

              non-calcemic physiological actions of vitamin D have drawn a

              National Health Insurance Research Database to identify 6554
              incident SS cases during 2007-2012 and selected 98,310 non-SS

              mechanisms of neutrophils in SLE are poorly understood. METHODS:
              Patients with SLE were recruited from the First Affiliated
              Hospital of Nanchang University. The medical history, clinical
              manifestations, physical examination, laboratory measurements,
              therapeutic regimen and treatment response were recorded. The
              expression of costimulatory molecules including programmed death
              1 (PD-1), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), T-cell
              immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (Tim-3),
              CD40, T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and immunoreceptor
              tyrosine-based inhibitory domains (TIGIT), CD80 and CD86 on
              neutrophils were determined by flow cytometry. The frequencies of
              PD-L1-expressing neutrophils in patients with SLE were further
              analyzed for their correlation with markers of autoimmune
              response, inflammation, disease activity and severity of SLE.
              RESULTS: The frequency of PD-L1-expressing neutrophils was
              significantly elevated in SLE patients compared to the healthy
              controls (P < 0.0001). The frequency of PD-L1-expressing
              neutrophils in patients with SLE was increased significantly in
              subjects with high ANA titre, high anti-nRNP/Sm, high levels of

              at baseline and 9 months after treatment initiation in plasma
              from early RA patients (n = 34). We tested for correlations with

              synovial fluid (SF) from patients with chronic RA (> 8 years of

              of PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1. RESULTS: sPD-1 concentrations in
              early [median 0.421 ng/mL, interquartile range (IQR) 0.04-2.560

              associated with DAS28 (r = 0.363, p < 0.05) and HAQ score (r =
              0.554, p < 0.05) and inversely with TSS at 3-5 years (r = -0.468,

              antibodies, and IL-21 (all p < 0.05). PD-1 was primarily
              expressed by synovial memory T cells whereas PD-L1 was mainly
              expressed by synovial monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The significantly
              elevated plasma levels of sPD-1 in early RA, the association with
              core disease parameters, and the inverse correlation with TSS

              analysis was done with respect to inflammation, smoking,
              treatments, and autoantibody status. The effect of therapeutic
              TNF-inhibiting antibodies (TNFi) on sPD-L1 was studied in 16 RA
              patients at their first infliximab infusion. The expression of
              Fc$\gamma$-receptor (Fc$\gamma$R) subclass IIB and IIIA was

              Results: The negative association between smoking and sPD-L1 in
              RA patients was established by multiple logistic regression (OR =
              0.52, p = 0.038). Other covariates in the regression model were
              serum levels of IL-1$\beta$ representing inflammation (OR = 1.6,
              p = 0.0076) and aCCP positivity (OR = 1.9, p = 0.047). First
              infliximab infusion repressed sPD-L1 (p = 0.023) in patients, and
              low levels of sPD-L1 were found in patients with early RA treated
              with TNFi (p = 0.018). Treatment with TNFi was associated with
              higher sPD-L1 in patients with long disease duration (p = 0.041)
              and restored levels in smokers. In vitro exposure to aCCP+ IgG
              suppressed sPD-L1 (p = 0.036), but aCCP+ patients with long
              disease duration had higher sPD-L1 (p = 0.016). High ratio of the
              inhibitory Fc$\gamma$R subclass IIB over the stimulatory IIIA
              resulted in low sPD-L1 release (p = 0.029). Smoking was
              associated with a higher Fc$\gamma$R IIB/IIIA ratio (p = 0.00062)
              and lower levels of sPD-L1 (p = 0.013). Conclusion: In RA, serum
              sPD-L1 was related to systemic inflammation and aCCP positivity.
              Smoking altered the expression of Fc$\gamma$Rs and limited sPD-L1

              (PD-L1/PD-1) signaling pathway is an important component of tumor
              immunosuppression, which can inhibit the activation of T

              lupus monocytes. Conversely, TGF-$\beta$ inversely correlated
              with PD-L1 in SLE and suppressed expression of PD-L1 on healthy
              monocytes. Therefore, PD-L1 expression in monocytes is regulated
              by opposing actions of TNF-$\alpha$ and TGF-$\beta$. As PD-L1
              functions to fine tune lymphocyte activation, dysregulation of

              expression on CD19+ B-cells and their subsets, with particular
              reference to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), have not yet
              been studied in detail. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to
              investigate PD-L1 expression on CD19+ B-cells and their subsets,
              in addition to exploring its possible role in Tfh-cell activation
              and B-cell differentiation in SLE. METHODS: Frequencies of CD19+
              B-cells, their subsets, PD-L1 and Tfh cells in the peripheral
              blood of SLE patients and healthy controls (HCs) were determined
              using cytometry. The clinical data of SLE patients were recorded
              in detail, and the correlation between their laboratory
              parameters, clinical parameters and disease activity indices was
              statistically analyzed. CD19+PD-L1+B-cells and CD19+PD-L1-
              B-cells were sorted and cultured with a stimulant, following
              which the supernatants were collected for immunoglobulin G and
              anti-double stranded DNA detection via enzyme-linked
              immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In SLE patients, CD19+B-cells and
              partial subgroups were enriched in peripheral blood. Also, the
              observed increase in the frequency of CD19+PD-L1+B-cells was
              significantly associated with a higher disease activity index. An
              in vitro culture test demonstrated that the amounts of anti-dsDNA
              and immunoglobulin G secreted by the CD19+PD-L1+B-cells of SLE
              patients and HCs were vastly different. In addition, a strong
              correlation existed between the frequencies of CD19+PD-L1+B-cells
              and defined Tfh cells of SLE patients. CONCLUSION: This study
              demonstrated that the expression of CD19+PD-L1+B-cells in the

              responses against invading microbes and tumor antigens while
              preventing inappropriate autoimmune responses against
              self-antigens with the help of T-regulatory (Treg) cells. Thus,
              Treg and Teff cells help maintain immune homeostasis through
              mutual regulation. While Tregs can contribute to tumor immune
              evasion by suppressing anti-tumor Teff response, loss of Treg
              function can result in Teff responses against self-antigens
              leading to autoimmune disease. Thus, loss of homeostatic balance
              between Teff/Treg cells is often associated with both cancer and
              autoimmunity. Co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptors,
              collectively known as co-signaling receptors, play an
              indispensable role in the regulation of Teff and Treg cell
              expansion and function and thus play critical roles in modulating
              autoimmune and anti-tumor immune responses. Over the past three
              decades, considerable efforts have been made to understand the
              biology of co-signaling receptors and their role in immune
              homeostasis. Mutations in co-inhibitory receptors such as CTLA4
              and PD1 are associated with Treg dysfunction, and autoimmune
              diseases in mice and humans. On the other hand, growing tumors
              evade immune surveillance by exploiting co-inhibitory signaling
              through expression of CTLA4, PD1 and PDL-1. Immune checkpoint
              blockade (ICB) using anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 has drawn
              considerable attention towards co-signaling receptors in tumor
              immunology and created renewed interest in studying other
              co-signaling receptors, which until recently have not been as
              well studied. In addition to co-inhibitory receptors,
              co-stimulatory receptors like OX40, GITR and 4-1BB have also been
              widely implicated in immune homeostasis and T-cell stimulation,
              and use of agonistic antibodies against OX40, GITR and 4-1BB has
              been effective in causing tumor regression. Although ICB has seen
              unprecedented success in cancer treatment, autoimmune adverse
              events arising from ICB due to loss of Treg homeostasis poses a
              major obstacle. Herein, we comprehensively review the role of

              genome-wide loss-of-function studies for therapeutic target
              discovery. As in many large-scale assays, however, off-target
              effects, variable reagents' potency and experimental noise must
              be accounted for appropriately control for false positives.
              Indeed, rigorous statistical analysis of high-throughput FG

              analyses are used to combine multiple sh/sgRNAs targeting the

              repositories that are publicly available to evaluate a novel
              meta-analysis approach for FG screens via Bayesian hierarchical
              modeling, Screening Bayesian Evaluation and Analysis Method

              potential drug targets. Here, we report the development of an
              efficient, robust approach to perform genome-scale pooled shRNA
              screens for both positive and negative selection and its
              application to systematically identify cell essential genes in 12
              cancer cell lines. By integrating these functional data with
              comprehensive genetic analyses of primary human tumors, we
              identified known and putative oncogenes such as EGFR, KRAS, MYC,
              BCR-ABL, MYB, CRKL, and CDK4 that are essential for cancer cell
              proliferation and also altered in human cancers. We further used
              this approach to identify genes involved in the response of
              cancer cells to tumoricidal agents and found 4 genes required for
              the response of CML cells to imatinib treatment: PTPN1, NF1,
              SMARCB1, and SMARCE1, and 5 regulators of the response to FAS
              activation, FAS, FADD, CASP8, ARID1A and CBX1. Broad application
              of this highly parallel genetic screening strategy will not only
              facilitate the rapid identification of genes that drive the
              malignant state and its response to therapeutics but will also
              enable the discovery of genes that participate in any biological

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic
              repeats (CRISPR) screens are usually implemented in cultured
              cells to identify genes with critical functions. Although several
              methods have been developed or adapted to analyze CRISPR
              screening data, no single specific algorithm has gained
              popularity. Thus, rigorous procedures are needed to overcome the
              shortcomings of existing algorithms. METHODS: We developed a
              Permutation-Based Non-Parametric Analysis (PBNPA) algorithm,
              which computes p-values at the gene level by permuting sgRNA
              labels, and thus it avoids restrictive distributional
              assumptions. Although PBNPA is designed to analyze CRISPR data,
              it can also be applied to analyze genetic screens implemented
              with siRNAs or shRNAs and drug screens. RESULTS: We compared the
              performance of PBNPA with competing methods on simulated data as
              well as on real data. PBNPA outperformed recent methods designed
              for CRISPR screen analysis, as well as methods used for analyzing
              other functional genomics screens, in terms of Receiver Operating
              Characteristics (ROC) curves and False Discovery Rate (FDR)
              control for simulated data under various settings. Remarkably,
              the PBNPA algorithm showed better consistency and FDR control on
              published real data as well. CONCLUSIONS: PBNPA yields more
              consistent and reliable results than its competitors, especially
              when the data quality is low. R package of PBNPA is available at:

              human whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or
              fibroblasts of patients with PIDs and of control subjects for
              subsequent meta-analysis, query and interpretation. A total of
              nineteen (19) datasets derived from studies of PID patients were
              identified and retrieved from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus
              (GEO) database and loaded in GXB, a custom web application

              consequences of the underlying, naturally occurring gene defects

              advanced-stage gastric cancer (GC). These PD1+ tumor-associated

              carcinomas (HNSCC) is highly immunosuppressive. HNSCCs expressing

              of PD-L1+ exosomes to immune suppression and disease activity are

              40 HNSCC patients by size exclusion chromatography were captured
              on beads using anti-CD63 Abs, stained for PD-1 and PD-L1 and
              analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentages and mean fluorescence
              intensities (MFI) of PD-L1+ and PD-1+ exosome/bead complexes were
              correlated with the patients' clinicopathologic data. PD-L1high
              or PD-L1low exosomes were incubated with activated CD69+ human
              CD8+ T cells $\pm$ PD-1 inhibitor. Changes in CD69 expression
              levels on T cells were measured. Patients' plasma was tested for
              soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) by ELISA.Results: Levels of PD-L1 carried
              by exosomes correlated with patients' disease activity, the UICC
              stage and the lymph node status (P = 0.0008-0.013). In contrast,
              plasma levels of sPD-L1 or exosome PD-1 levels did not correlate
              with any clinicopathologic parameters. CD69 expression levels
              were inhibited (P < 0.03) by coincubation with PD-L1high but not
              by PD-L1low exosomes. Blocking of PD-L1+ exosome signaling to

              confounding factor when interpreting CRISPR-Cas9 screens is the
              high false-positive rate in detecting essential genes within copy
              number amplified regions of the genome. We have developed the
              computational tool CRISPRcleanR which is capable of identifying
              and correcting gene-independent responses to CRISPR-Cas9
              targeting. CRISPRcleanR uses an unsupervised approach based on
              the segmentation of single-guide RNA fold change values across
              the genome, without making any assumption about the copy number
              status of the targeted genes. RESULTS: Applying our method to
              existing and newly generated genome-wide essentiality profiles
              from 15 cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that CRISPRcleanR
              reduces false positives when calling essential genes, correcting
              biases within and outside of amplified regions, while maintaining
              true positive rates. Established cancer dependencies and
              essentiality signals of amplified cancer driver genes are
              detectable post-correction. CRISPRcleanR reports sgRNA fold
              changes and normalised read counts, is therefore compatible with

              Therefore, it is imperative to find an effective biomarker
              measuring disease activity and organ damage for SLE management.
              The present study investigated the possibility of serum
              calreticulin (CRT) in the assessment of disease activity and
              organ damage in SLE patients. Serum CRT levels from 80 patients
              with SLE, 55 patients with other autoimmune diseases and 60
              healthy controls (HC) were measured by ELISA. Disease activity
              was assessed using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease
              Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) scores. Organ damage was
              evaluated with the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating
              Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index. CRT levels
              in SLE were significantly higher than that in other autoimmune
              diseases and HC. CRT was correlated with SLEDAI-2K score
              (r=0.3345, P=0.0024), and with anti-double-stranded DNA
              (anti-dsDNA) (r=0.4483, P<0.0001). A significant negative
              correlation of CRT levels with complement 3 (r=-0.3635, P=0.0009)
              and complement 4 (r=-0.3507, P=0.0014) was observed in patients
              with SLE. Furthermore, the patients with SLE and a positive
              anti-Ro52 result had higher levels of CRT compared with those
              with a negative anti-Ro52 result (P<0.001). Elevated levels of
              CRT were also reported among patients with SLE who also indicated
              the presence of cumulative organ damage. In addition, increased
              expression of CRT correlated with the presence of lupus
              nephritis. In conclusion, the results of the current report
              provided that CRT may be used as a potential biomarker for
              clinical diagnosis and of prognosis, providing additional
              information regarding disease activity and organ damage alongside
              other traditional indices.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Approximately 50 to 60\% of patients with essential
              thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis carry a mutation in the
              Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2), and an additional 5 to 10\% have
              activating mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor gene (MPL).
              So far, no specific molecular marker has been identified in the
              remaining 30 to 45\% of patients. METHODS: We performed
              whole-exome sequencing to identify somatically acquired mutations
              in six patients who had primary myelofibrosis without mutations
              in JAK2 or MPL. Resequencing of CALR, encoding calreticulin, was
              then performed in cohorts of patients with myeloid neoplasms.
              RESULTS: Somatic insertions or deletions in exon 9 of CALR were
              detected in all patients who underwent whole-exome sequencing.
              Resequencing in 1107 samples from patients with
              myeloproliferative neoplasms showed that CALR mutations were
              absent in polycythemia vera. In essential thrombocythemia and
              primary myelofibrosis, CALR mutations and JAK2 and MPL mutations
              were mutually exclusive. Among patients with essential
              thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis with nonmutated JAK2 or
              MPL, CALR mutations were detected in 67\% of those with essential
              thrombocythemia and 88\% of those with primary myelofibrosis. A
              total of 36 types of insertions or deletions were identified that
              all cause a frameshift to the same alternative reading frame and
              generate a novel C-terminal peptide in the mutant calreticulin.
              Overexpression of the most frequent CALR deletion caused
              cytokine-independent growth in vitro owing to the activation of
              signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) by
              means of an unknown mechanism. Patients with mutated CALR had a
              lower risk of thrombosis and longer overall survival than
              patients with mutated JAK2. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with
              essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis that was not
              associated with a JAK2 or MPL alteration carried a somatic
              mutation in CALR. The clinical course in these patients was more
              indolent than that in patients with the JAK2 V617F mutation.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Count data generated by next-generation sequencing
              assays do not measure absolute transcript abundances. Instead,
              the data are constrained to an arbitrary ``library size'' by the
              sequencing depth of the assay, and typically must be normalized
              prior to statistical analysis. The constrained nature of these
              data means one could alternatively use a log-ratio transformation
              in lieu of normalization, as often done when testing for
              differential abundance (DA) of operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
              in 16S rRNA data. Therefore, we benchmark how well the ALDEx2
              package, a transformation-based DA tool, detects differential
              expression in high-throughput RNA-sequencing data (RNA-Seq),
              compared to conventional RNA-Seq methods such as edgeR and
              DESeq2. RESULTS: To evaluate the performance of log-ratio
              transformation-based tools, we apply the ALDEx2 package to two
              simulated, and two real, RNA-Seq data sets. One of the latter was
              previously used to benchmark dozens of conventional RNA-Seq
              differential expression methods, enabling us to directly compare
              transformation-based approaches. We show that ALDEx2, widely used
              in meta-genomics research, identifies differentially expressed
              genes (and transcripts) from RNA-Seq data with high precision
              and, given sufficient sample sizes, high recall too (regardless
              of the alignment and quantification procedure used). Although we
              show that the choice in log-ratio transformation can affect
              performance, ALDEx2 has high precision (i.e., few false
              positives) across all transformations. Finally, we present a
              novel, iterative log-ratio transformation (now implemented in
              ALDEx2) that further improves performance in simulations.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that log-ratio
              transformation-based methods can work to measure differential
              expression from RNA-Seq data, provided that certain assumptions
              are met. Moreover, these methods have very high precision (i.e.,
              few false positives) in simulations and perform well on real data
              too. With previously demonstrated applicability to 16S rRNA data,
              ALDEx2 can thus serve as a single tool for data from multiple
              sequencing modalities.",

              sample groups have played a key role in many genomic studies.
              Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) has been commonly used for
              pathway or functional analysis of microarray data, and it is also
              being applied to RNA-seq data. However, most RNA-seq data so far
              have only small replicates. This enforces to apply the
              gene-permuting GSEA method (or preranked GSEA) which results in a
              great number of false positives due to the inter-gene correlation

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In differential expression analysis of RNA-sequencing
              (RNA-seq) read count data for two sample groups, it is known that
              highly expressed genes (or longer genes) are more likely to be
              differentially expressed which is called read count bias (or gene

              Ontology over-representation analysis. However, such a bias has
              not been systematically analyzed for different replicate types of

              a gene in the negative binomial modeling of read counts is the
              critical determinant of the read count bias (and gene length
              bias) by mathematical inference and tests for a number of
              simulated and real RNA-seq datasets. We demonstrate that the read
              count bias is mostly confined to data with small gene dispersions
              (e.g., technical replicates and some of genetically identical
              replicates such as cell lines or inbred animals), and many

  abstract = "RNA-seq has been an increasingly popular high-throughput platform
              to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes, which is much
              more reproducible and accurate than the previous microarray
              technology. Yet, a number of statistical issues remain to be
              resolved in data analysis, largely due to the high-throughput
              data volume and over-dispersion of read counts. These problems
              become more challenging for those biologists who use RNA-seq to
              measure genome-wide expression profiles in different combinations
              of sampling resources (species or genotypes) or treatments. In
              this paper, the author first reviews the statistical methods
              available for detecting DE genes, which have implemented negative
              binomial (NB) models and/or quasi-likelihood (QL) approaches to
              account for the over-dispersion problem in RNA-seq samples. The
              author then studies how to carry out the DE test in the context
              of phylogeny, i.e., RNA-seq samples are from a range of species

              framework to solve this phylo-DE problem: While an NB model is
              used to account for data over-dispersion within biological

              taken into account by QL, plus some special treatments for

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In current statistical methods for calling
              differentially expressed genes in RNA-Seq experiments, the
              assumption is that an adjusted observed gene count represents an
              unknown true gene count. This adjustment usually consists of a
              normalization step to account for heterogeneous sample library
              sizes, and then the resulting normalized gene counts are used as
              input for parametric or non-parametric differential gene
              expression tests. A distribution of true gene counts, each with a
              different probability, can result in the same observed gene
              count. Importantly, sequencing coverage information is currently
              not explicitly incorporated into any of the statistical models
              used for RNA-Seq analysis. RESULTS: We developed a fast Bayesian
              method which uses the sequencing coverage information determined
              from the concentration of an RNA sample to estimate the posterior
              distribution of a true gene count. Our method has better or
              comparable performance compared to NOISeq and GFOLD, according to
              the results from simulations and experiments with real

              microbiome data sets has lagged behind our ability to acquire
              such data sets from environmental or clinical samples. Sequencing
              instruments impose a structure on these data: the natural sample
              space of a 16S rRNA gene sequencing data set is a simplex, which
              is a part of real space that is restricted to nonnegative values
              with a constant sum. Such data are compositional and should be
              analyzed using compositionally appropriate tools and approaches.
              However, most of the tools for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis
              assume these data are unrestricted. METHODS: We show that
              existing tools for compositional data (CoDa) analysis can be

              elements of microbiome analysis. Reanalysis of a publicly

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive
              disease characterized by recurrent lung infections. Studies of
              the lung microbiome have shown an association between decreasing
              diversity and progressive disease. 454 pyrosequencing has
              frequently been used to study the lung microbiome in CF, but will
              no longer be supported. We sought to identify the benefits and
              drawbacks of using two state-of-the-art next generation
              sequencing (NGS) platforms, MiSeq and PacBio RSII, to
              characterize the CF lung microbiome. Each has its advantages and
              limitations. METHODS: Twelve samples of extracted bacterial DNA
              were sequenced on both MiSeq and PacBio NGS platforms. DNA was
              amplified for the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and libraries
              were sequenced on the MiSeq sequencing platform, while the full
              16S rRNA gene was sequenced on the PacBio RSII sequencing
              platform. Raw FASTQ files generated by the MiSeq and PacBio
              platforms were processed in mothur v1.35.1. RESULTS: There was
              extreme discordance in alpha-diversity of the CF lung microbiome
              when using the two platforms. Because of its depth of coverage,
              sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 gene region using MiSeq allowed for
              the observation of many more operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
              and higher Chao1 and Shannon indices than the PacBio RSII.
              Interestingly, several patients in our cohort had Escherichia, an
              unusual pathogen in CF. Also, likely because of its coverage of
              the complete 16S rRNA gene, only PacBio RSII was able to identify
              Burkholderia, an important CF pathogen. CONCLUSION: When
              comparing microbiome diversity in clinical samples from CF
              patients using 16S sequences, MiSeq and PacBio NGS platforms may
              generate different results in microbial community composition and
              structure. It may be necessary to use different platforms when
              trying to correctly identify dominant pathogens versus measuring
              alpha-diversity estimates, and it would be important to use the
              same platform for comparisons to minimize errors in
              interpretation.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: There is an immense scientific interest in the human
              microbiome and its effects on human physiology, health, and
              disease. A common approach for examining bacterial communities is
              high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene hypervariable
              regions, aggregating sequence-similar amplicons into operational
              taxonomic units (OTUs). Strategies for detecting differential
              relative abundance of OTUs between sample conditions include
              classical statistical approaches as well as a plethora of newer
              methods, many borrowing from the related field of RNA-seq
              analysis. This effort is complicated by unique data
              characteristics, including sparsity, sequencing depth variation,
              and nonconformity of read counts to theoretical distributions,
              which is often exacerbated by exploratory and/or unbalanced study
              designs. Here, we assess the robustness of available methods for
              (1) inference in differential relative abundance analysis and (2)
              beta-diversity-based sample separation, using a rigorous
              benchmarking framework based on large clinical 16S microbiome
              datasets from different sources. RESULTS: Running more than
              380,000 full differential relative abundance tests on real
              datasets with permuted case/control assignments and in
              silico-spiked OTUs, we identify large differences in method
              performance on a range of parameters, including false positive
              rates, sensitivity to sparsity and case/control balances, and
              spike-in retrieval rate. In large datasets, methods with the
              highest false positive rates also tend to have the best detection
              power. For beta-diversity-based sample separation, we show that
              library size normalization has very little effect and that the
              distance metric is the most important factor in terms of
              separation power. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, generalizable to
              datasets from different sequencing platforms, demonstrate how the
              choice of method considerably affects analysis outcome. Here, we
              give recommendations for tools that exhibit low false positive
              rates, have good retrieval power across effect sizes and
              case/control proportions, and have low sparsity bias. Result
              output from some commonly used methods should be interpreted with
              caution. We provide an easily extensible framework for
              benchmarking of new methods and future microbiome datasets.",

  abstract = "With the surge of next generation high-throughput technologies,
              RNA-seq data is playing an increasingly important role in disease
              diagnosis, in which normalization is assumed as an essential
              procedure to produce comparable samples. Recent studies have seen
              different normalization methods proposed to remove various
              technical biases in RNA sequencing. However, there are no
              previous studies evaluating the impacts of normalization on
              RNA-seq disease diagnosis. In this study, we investigate this
              problem by analyzing structured big data: RNA-seq data acquired
              from the TCGA portal for its popularity in RNA-seq disease
              diagnosis. We propose a novel normalization effect test
              algorithm, diagnostic index (d-index), and data entropy to
              analyze and evaluate the impacts of normalization on RNA-seq
              disease diagnosis by using state-of-the-art machine learning
              models. Furthermore, we present an original visualization
              analysis to compare the performance of normalized data versus raw
              data. We have found that normalized data yields generally an
              equivalent or even lower level diagnosis than its raw data.
              Moreover, some normalization approaches (e.g. RPKM) even bring
              negative effects in disease diagnosis. On the other hand, raw
              data seems to have the potential to decipher pathological status
              better or at least comparable than when the data is normalized.
              Our visualization analysis also shows that some normalization
              methods even bring 'outliers', which unavoidably decreases sample
              detectability in diagnosis. More importantly, our data entropy
              analysis shows that normalized data usually demonstrates
              equivalent or lower entropy values than raw data. Those data with
              high entropy values tend to achieve better diagnosis than those
              with low entropy values. In addition, we found that
              high-dimensional imbalance (HDI) data is unaffected by any
              normalization procedures in diagnosis, and fails almost all
              machine learning models by only recognizing majority types in
              spite of raw or normalized data. Our results suggest that
              normalized data may not demonstrate statistically significant
              advantages in disease diagnosis than its raw form. It further
              implies that normalization may not be an indispensable procedure
              in RNA-seq disease diagnosis or at least some normalization
              processes may not be. Instead, raw data may perform better for
              capturing more original transcriptome patterns in different

              nervous system recovery is highlighted by in vitro experiments
              demonstrating their capacity to transdifferentiate into neurons.
              Understanding astrocyte plasticity could be advanced by comparing
              astrocytes with stem cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is ideal for
              comparing differences across cell types. However, this novel
              multi-stage process has the potential to introduce unwanted
              technical variation at several points in the experimental
              workflow. Quantitative understanding of the contribution of
              experimental parameters to technical variation would facilitate
              the design of robust RNA-Seq experiments. RESULTS: RNA-Seq was
              used to achieve biological and technical objectives. The
              biological aspect compared gene expression between normal human
              fetal-derived astrocytes and human neural stem cells cultured in
              identical conditions. When differential expression threshold
              criteria of |log2 fold change| > 2 were applied to the data, no
              significant differences were observed. The technical component
              quantified variation arising from particular steps in the
              research pathway, and compared the ability of different
              normalization methods to reduce unwanted variance. To facilitate
              this objective, a liberal false discovery rate of 10\% and a
              |log2 fold change| > 0.5 were implemented for the differential
              expression threshold. Data were normalized with RPKM, TMM, and
              UQS methods using JMP Genomics. The contributions of key
              replicable experimental parameters (cell lot; library
              preparation; flow cell) to variance in the data were evaluated
              using principal variance component analysis. Our analysis showed
              that, although the variance for every parameter is strongly
              influenced by the normalization method, the largest contributor
              to technical variance was library preparation. The ability to
              detect differentially expressed genes was also affected by
              normalization; differences were only detected in non-normalized
              and TMM-normalized data. CONCLUSIONS: The similarity in gene
              expression between astrocytes and neural stem cells supports the
              potential for astrocytic transdifferentiation into neurons, and
              emphasizes the need to evaluate the therapeutic potential of
              astrocytes for central nervous system damage. The choice of
              normalization method influences the contributions to experimental
              variance as well as the outcomes of differential expression
              analysis. However irrespective of normalization method, our
              findings illustrate that library preparation contributed the
              largest component of technical variance.",

              there are numerous methods for read count normalization, it
              remains a challenge to choose an optimal method due to multiple
              factors contributing to read count variability that affects the
              overall sensitivity and specificity. In order to properly
              determine the most appropriate normalization methods, it is
              critical to compare the performance and shortcomings of a
              representative set of normalization routines based on different
              dataset characteristics. Therefore, we set out to evaluate the
              performance of the commonly used methods (DESeq, TMM-edgeR,
              FPKM-CuffDiff, TC, Med UQ and FQ) and two new methods we propose:
              Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2 (per-gene normalization after per-sample
              median or upper-quartile global scaling). Our per-gene
              normalization approach allows for comparisons between conditions
              based on similar count levels. Using the benchmark Microarray
              Quality Control Project (MAQC) and simulated datasets, we
              performed differential gene expression analysis to evaluate these
              methods. When evaluating MAQC2 with two replicates, we observed
              that Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2 achieved a slightly higher area under
              the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), a specificity
              rate > 85\%, the detection power > 92\% and an actual false
              discovery rate (FDR) under 0.06 given the nominal FDR
              ($\leq$0.05). Although the top commonly used methods (DESeq and
              TMM-edgeR) yield a higher power (>93\%) for MAQC2 data, they
              trade off with a reduced specificity (<70\%) and a slightly
              higher actual FDR than our proposed methods. In addition, the
              results from an analysis based on the qualitative characteristics
              of sample distribution for MAQC2 and human breast cancer datasets
              show that only our gene-wise normalization methods corrected data
              skewed towards lower read counts. However, when we evaluated
              MAQC3 with less variation in five replicates, all methods
              performed similarly. Thus, our proposed Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2
              methods perform slightly better for differential gene analysis of
              RNA-seq data skewed towards lowly expressed read counts with high

              and across sample normalization methods (SVA, RUV, and PCA) for

              the known and estimated latent artifacts in the design matrix to
              correctly account for the loss in degrees of freedom, as opposed

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The rheumatoid arthritis (RA) shared epitope (SE), a
              major risk factor for severe disease, is a five amino acid motif
              in the third allelic hypervariable region of the HLA-DRbeta
              chain. The molecular mechanisms by which the SE affects
              susceptibility to--and severity of--RA are unknown. We have
              recently demonstrated that the SE acts as a ligand that interacts
              with cell surface calreticulin (CRT) and activates innate immune
              signaling. In order to better understand the molecular basis of
              SE-RA association, here we have undertaken to map the SE binding
              site on CRT. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
              experiments with domain deletion mutants suggested that the SE
              binding site is located in the P-domain of CRT. The role of this
              domain as a SE-binding region was further confirmed by a
              sulfosuccinimidyl-2-[6-(biotinamido)-2-(p-azido-benzamido)
              hexanoamido] ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (sulfo-SBED) photoactive
              cross-linking method. In silico analysis of docking interactions
              between a conformationally intact SE ligand and the CRT P-domain
              predicted the region within amino acid residues 217-224 as a
              potential SE binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated
              involvement of residues Glu(217) and Glu(223)--and to a lesser
              extent residue Asp(220)--in cell-free SPR-based binding and
              signal transduction assays. SIGNIFICANCE: We have characterized
              here the molecular basis of a novel ligand-receptor interaction
              between the SE and CRT. The interaction represents a structurally
              and functionally well-defined example of cross talk between the
              adaptive and innate immune systems that could advance our
              understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.",

              Quality values provide valuable information, but are primarily
              used only for trimming sequences and generally ignored in

              scoring schemes of standard alignment algorithms can be modified
              to take into account quality values to produce improved
              alignments and statistically more accurate scores. A prototype
              implementation is also provided, and used to post-process a set

              research, such that precise genome editing has now become routine
              for many labs within several years of its initial development.
              What makes CRISPR/Cas9 so revolutionary is the ability to target
              a protein (Cas9) to an exact genomic locus, through designing a
              specific short complementary nucleotide sequence, that together
              with a common scaffold sequence, constitute the guide RNA
              bridging the protein and the DNA. Wild-type Cas9 cleaves both DNA
              strands at its target sequence, but this protein can also be
              modified to exert many other functions. For instance, by
              attaching an activation domain to catalytically inactive Cas9 and
              targeting a promoter region, it is possible to stimulate the
              expression of a specific endogenous gene. In principle, any
              genomic region can be targeted, and recent efforts have
              successfully generated pooled guide RNA libraries for coding and
              regulatory regions of human, mouse and Drosophila genomes with
              high coverage, thus facilitating functional phenotypic screening.

              widely applied to identify the effect of gene knockout on
              cellular phenotype. Although many screens were successful, they
              also have the limitation that genes conferring mild phenotypes or
              those essential for growth can be overlooked, as every genetic
              perturbation is incorporated in the same population. Arrayed
              screens, on the other hand, incorporate a single genetic
              perturbation in each well and could overcome these limitations.
              However, arrayed screens based on siRNA-mediated knockdown were
              recently criticized for low reproducibility caused by incomplete
              inhibition of gene expression. To overcome these limitations, we
              developed a novel arrayed CRISPR screen based on a plasmid
              library expressing a single guide RNA (sgRNA) and disrupted 1514
              genes, encoding kinases, proteins related to endocytosis, and
              Golgi-localized proteins, individually using 4542 sgRNAs (three
              sgRNAs per gene). This screen revealed host factors required for
              infection by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) from Picornaviridae, which
              includes human pathogens causing diverse diseases. Many host
              factors that had been overlooked in a conventional pooled screen
              were identified for CVB3 infection, including entry-related
              factors, translational initiation factors, and several
              replication factors with different functions, demonstrating the
              advantage of the arrayed screen. This screen was quite reliable
              and reproducible, as most genes identified in the primary screen
              were confirmed in secondary screens. Moreover, ACBD3, whose
              phenotype was not affected by siRNA-mediated knockdown, was
              reliably identified. We propose that arrayed CRISPR screens based
              on sgRNA plasmid libraries are powerful tools for arrayed genetic
              screening and applicable to larger-scale screens.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The onset of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
              is preceded by the presence of specific autoantibodies in the
              absence of synovial inflammation. Only a subset of these at-risk
              individuals will develop clinical disease. This impedes efforts
              to implement early interventions that may prevent onset of
              clinically manifest disease. Here we analyse whether clonal
              changes in the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire can reliably
              predict onset of signs and symptoms. METHODS: In a prospective
              cohort study in 21 individuals at risk for RA based on the
              presence of autoantibodies, the BCR repertoire of paired
              peripheral blood and synovial tissue samples was analysed using
              next-generation BCR sequencing. BCR clones that were expanded
              beyond 0.5\% of the total repertoire were labelled dominant. The
              relative risk (RR) for onset of arthritis was assessed using the
              presence of $\geq$5 dominant BCR clones as cut-off. Findings in
              peripheral blood were validated in an independent prospective
              cohort of 50 at-risk individuals. Based on the test cohort,
              individuals in the validation cohort were considered positive if
              peripheral blood at study entry showed $\geq$5 dominant BCR
              clones. FINDINGS: Both in the test and validation cohort, the
              presence of $\geq$5 dominant BCR clones in peripheral blood was
              significantly associated with arthritis development after
              follow-up (validation cohort RR 6.3, 95\% CI 2.7 to 15,
              p<1$\times$10-4). Even when adjusted for a recently described
              clinical prediction rule the association remained intact (RR 5.0,
              95\% CI 1.2 to 20, p=0.024). When individuals developed
              arthritis, dominant BCR clones disappeared from peripheral blood
              and appeared in synovial tissue, suggesting a direct role of
              these clones in disease pathogenesis. INTERPRETATION: Dominant
              BCR clones in peripheral blood predict onset of clinical signs
              and symptoms of RA in at-risk individuals with high accuracy. Our
              data suggest that during onset of RA these clones shift from

              repertoire of unique sequences that enable individuals to
              recognize a diverse range of antigens. After encountering antigen
              for the first time, BCRs undergo a process of affinity
              maturation, whereby cycles of rapid somatic mutation and
              selection lead to improved antigen binding. This constitutes an
              accelerated evolutionary process that takes place over days or
              weeks. Next-generation sequencing of the gene regions that
              determine BCR binding has begun to reveal the diversity and

              of the humoral response against HIV-1 is limited. Here, we
              interrogated the antibody repertoires of multiple HIV-infected
              donors from an infection-naive state through acute and chronic
              infection using next-generation sequencing. This analysis
              revealed the existence of ``public'' antibody clonotypes that
              were shared among multiple HIV-infected individuals. The HIV-1
              reactivity for representative antibodies from an identified
              public clonotype shared by three donors was confirmed.
              Furthermore, a meta-analysis of publicly available antibody
              repertoire sequencing datasets revealed antibodies with high
              sequence identity to known HIV-reactive antibodies, even in
              repertoires that were reported to be HIV naive. The discovery of
              public antibody clonotypes in HIV-infected individuals represents
              an avenue of significant potential for better understanding
              antibody responses to HIV-1 infection, as well as for
              clonotype-specific vaccine development.",

              the antitumor activity of anti-PD-L1 antibody plus irinotecan was

              tumor-infiltrating CD8+ cells was higher than either irinotecan
              or anti-PD-L1 antibody monotherapy. Irinotecan was found to

              can potentially interact with many different T cell epitopes. To
              better define the potential for TCR cross-reactivity between
              epitopes derived from the human genome, the human microbiome, and
              human pathogens, we developed a new immunoinformatics tool,
              JanusMatrix, that represents an extension of the validated T cell
              epitope mapping tool, EpiMatrix. Initial explorations, summarized
              in this synopsis, have uncovered what appear to be important
              differences in the TCR cross-reactivity of selected regulatory
              and effector T cell epitopes with other epitopes in the human
              genome, human microbiome, and selected human pathogens. In
              addition to exploring the T cell epitope relationships between
              human self, commensal and pathogen, JanusMatrix may also be
              useful to explore some aspects of heterologous immunity and to
              examine T cell epitope relatedness between pathogens to which
              humans are exposed (Dengue serotypes, or HCV and Influenza, for
              example). In Hand-Foot-Mouth disease (HFMD) for example,
              extensive enterovirus and human microbiome cross-reactivity (and
              limited cross-reactivity with the human genome) seemingly
              predicts immunodominance. In contrast, more extensive
              cross-reactivity with proteins contained in the human genome as
              compared to the human microbiome was observed for selected Treg
              epitopes. While it may be impossible to predict all immune
              response influences, the availability of sequence data from the
              human genome, the human microbiome, and an array of human
              pathogens and vaccines has made computationally-driven
              exploration of the effects of T cell epitope cross-reactivity now
              possible. This is the first description of JanusMatrix, an
              algorithm that assesses TCR cross-reactivity that may contribute
              to a means of predicting the phenotype of T cells responding to
              selected T cell epitopes. Whether used for explorations of T cell

              different from IL-8(-)Foxp3(+)CD4(+) T cells in the same
              microenvironment. 40-60\% of IL-8(+)Foxp3(+)CD4(+) T cells

              commonly used in the clinic to treat various autoimmune and
              severe inflammatory diseases, the mode of action is not fully
              elucidated. This work investigates two proposed mechanisms: (1)
              the potential role of regulatory T-cell epitopes (Tregitopes)
              from the constant domain of IgG in the immunosuppressive function
              of IVIg; and (2) a potential impact of IVIg on the ability of
              antigen presenting cells (APCs) to present peptides. METHODS AND
              RESULTS: Investigation of the HLA class II peptide repertoire
              from IVIg-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) via MHC-associated peptide
              proteomics (MAPPs) revealed that numerous IgG-derived peptides
              were strongly presented along the antibody sequence.
              Surprisingly, Tregitopes 167 and 289 did not show efficient
              natural presentation although they both bound to HLA class II
              when directly loaded as ``naked'' peptides on human DCs. In
              addition, both Tregitopes could not reproduce the inhibitory
              effect of IVIg in a human in vitro T-cell proliferation assay as
              well as in vivo in mice. MAPPs data demonstrate that presentation
              of peptides from several antigens remained unchanged even when
              competed with high doses of IVIg, in both human and mouse.
              CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the effects mediated by IVIg

              patients by presenting idiotopes from their own immunoglobulin
              variable regions on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II

  abstract = "Immunoglobulins are highly diverse protein sequences that are
              processed and presented to T-cells by B-cells and other antigen
              presenting cells. We examined a large dataset of immunoglobulin
              heavy chain variable regions (IGHV) to assess the diversity of
              T-cell exposed motifs (TCEMs). TCEM comprise those amino acids in
              a MHC-bound peptide, which face outwards, surrounded by the MHC
              histotope, and which engage the T-cell receptor. Within IGHV
              there is a distinct pattern of predicted MHC class II binding and
              a very high frequency of re-use of the TCEMs. The re-use
              frequency indicates that only a limited number of different
              cognate T-cells are required to engage many different clonal
              B-cells. The amino acids in each outward-facing TCEM are
              intercalated with the amino acids of inward-facing MHC
              groove-exposed motifs (GEM). Different GEM may have differing,
              allele-specific, MHC binding affinities. The intercalation of
              TCEM and GEM in a peptide allows for a vast combinatorial
              repertoire of epitopes, each eliciting a different response.
              Outcome of T-cell receptor binding is determined by overall
              signal strength, which is a function of the number of responding
              T-cells and the duration of engagement. Hence, the frequency of
              TCEM re-use appears to be an important determinant of whether a
              T-cell response is stimulatory or suppressive. The frequency
              distribution of TCEMs implies that somatic hypermutation is
              followed by T-cell clonal expansion that develops along repeated
              pathways. The observations of TCEM and GEM derived from
              immunoglobulins suggest a relatively simple, yet powerful,
              mechanism to correlate T-cell polyspecificity, through re-use of
              TCEMs, with a very high degree of specificity achieved by
              combination with a diversity of GEMs. The frequency profile of
              TCEMs also points to an economical mechanism for maintaining
              T-cell memory, recall, and self-discrimination based on an
              endogenously generated profile of motifs.",

  abstract = "Helminth infections, by nematodes, trematodes, or cestodes, can
              lead to the modulation of host immune responses. This allows
              long-duration parasite infections and also impacts responses to
              co-infections. Surface, secreted, excreted, and shed proteins are
              thought to play a major role in modulation. A commonly reported
              feature of such immune modulation is the role of T regulatory
              (Treg) cells and IL-10. Efforts to identify helminth proteins,
              which cause immunomodulation, have identified candidates but not
              provided clarity as to a uniform mechanism driving modulation. In
              this study, we applied a bioinformatics systems approach,
              allowing us to analyze predicted T-cell epitopes of 17 helminth
              species and the responses to their surface proteins. In addition
              to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding, we analyzed
              amino acid motifs that would be recognized by T-cell receptors
              [T-cell-exposed motifs (TCEMs)]. All the helminth species
              examined have, within their surface proteins, peptides, which
              combine very common TCEMs with predicted high affinity binding to
              many human MHC alleles. This combination of features would result
              in large cognate T cell and a high probability of eliciting Treg
              responses. The TCEMs, which determine recognition by responding
              T-cell clones, are shared to a high degree between helminth
              species and with Plasmodium falciparum and Mycobacterium
              tuberculosis, both common co-infecting organisms. The implication
              of our observations is not only that Treg cells play a
              significant role in helminth-induced immune modulation but also
              that the epitope specificities of Treg responses are shared
              across species and genera of helminth. Hence, the immune response
              to a given helminth cannot be considered in isolation but rather
              forms part of an epitope ecosystem, or microenvironment, in which
              potentially immunosuppressive peptides in the helminth network

              epitopes in self proteins, microbiome, other helminths, and
              taxonomically unrelated pathogens. Such a systems approach
              provides a high-level view of the antigen-immune system signaling
              dynamics that may bias a host's immune response to helminth
              infections toward immune modulation. It may indicate how
              helminths have evolved to select for peptides that favor
              long-term parasite host coexistence.",

              and gastrointestinal microbiome organisms, with the human
              proteome and immunoglobulins. Given the maximum 20(5), or 3.2
              million of such motifs that bind T-cell receptors, there is
              considerable overlap in motif usage. We show that the human
              proteome, exclusive of immunoglobulins, only comprises three
              quarters of the possible motifs, of which 65.3\% are also present
              in both composite bacterial proteomes. Very few motifs are unique
              to the human proteome. Immunoglobulin variable regions carry a
              broad diversity of T-cell exposed motifs (TCEMs) that provides a
              stratified random sample of the motifs found in pathogens,
              microbiome, and the human proteome. Individual bacterial genera
              and species vary in the content of immunoglobulin and human
              proteome matched motifs that they carry. Mycobacteria and
              Burkholderia spp carry a particularly high content of such
              matched motifs. Some bacteria retain a unique motif signature and
              motif sharing pattern with the human proteome. The implication is
              that distinguishing self from non-self does not depend on
              individual TCEMs, but on a complex and dynamic overlay of signals
              wherein the same TCEM may play different roles in different
              organisms, and the frequency with which a particular TCEM appears
              influences its effect. The patterns observed provide clues to
              bacterial immune evasion and to strategies for intervention,
              including vaccine design. The breadth and distinct frequency
              patterns of the immunoglobulin-derived peptides suggest a role of
              immunoglobulins in maintaining a broadly responsive T-cell
              repertoire.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To design a pattern recognition engine based on
              concepts derived from mammalian immune systems. DESIGN: A
              supervised learning system (Immunos-81) was created using
              software abstractions of T cells, B cells, antibodies, and their
              interactions. Artificial T cells control the creation of B-cell
              populations (clones), which compete for recognition of
              ``unknowns.'' The B-cell clone with the ``simple highest
              avidity'' (SHA) or ``relative highest avidity'' (RHA) is
              considered to have successfully classified the unknown.
              MEASUREMENT: Two standard machine learning data sets, consisting
              of eight nominal and six continuous variables, were used to test
              the recognition capabilities of Immunos-81. The first set
              (Cleveland), consisting of 303 cases of patients with suspected
              coronary artery disease, was used to perform a ten-way
              cross-validation. After completing the validation runs, the
              Cleveland data set was used as a training set prior to
              presentation of the second data set, consisting of 200 unknown
              cases. RESULTS: For cross-validation runs, correct recognition
              using SHA ranged from a high of 96 percent to a low of 63.2
              percent. The average correct classification for all runs was 83.2
              percent. Using the RHA metric, 11.2 percent were labeled ``too
              close to determine'' and no further attempt was made to classify
              them. Of the remaining cases, 85.5 percent were correctly
              classified. When the second data set was presented, correct
              classification occurred in 73.5 percent of cases when SHA was
              used and in 80.3 percent of cases when RHA was used. CONCLUSIONS:
              The immune system offers a viable paradigm for the design of
              pattern recognition systems. Additional research is required to
              fully exploit the nuances of immune computation.",

              abatacept 125 mg (n=213) or placebo (n=211) for 24 weeks,

              regardless of tumour necrosis factor inhibitor exposure and in
              other musculoskeletal manifestations, but significance could not
              be attributed due to ranking below Health Assessment

              initiations of other bDMARDs, and 46 610 csDMARD users. The mean

              patients varied from 71\% to 80\%, across the 7 cohorts under

              000 person-years) for a first invasive solid or hematologic
              malignant neoplasm were 50 (959) for tocilizumab, 61 (1026) for

              TNFi as first bDMARD, and 169 (917) for TNFi as second bDMARD.
              There were no statistically significant differences between
              initiators of a first or second TNFi, or other bDMARDs, and
              bDMARD-naive RA for any of a total of 25 drug- and

              locally advanced and metastatic urothelial carcinoma for decades.
              Long-term survival remains stagnant around 12-14 months for
              patients with advanced disease who have progressed on or recurred
              after receiving first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Improving
              clinical outcomes for patients with urothelial carcinoma in all
              disease settings requires the development of novel treatments,
              especially for patients who failed on first-line chemotherapy.
              Since the discovery of intravesical Bacillus-Calmette Guerin
              (BCG) in the 1970s for non-muscle invasive disease, there have
              not been any major breakthrough drugs that exploit the
              immune-sensitivity of bladder cancer until recently.

              1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) and cytotoxic
              T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) pathways have shown
              significant anti-tumor activity, tolerable safety profiles and

              avelumab, durvalumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab are promising
              PD-1/PD-L1 blockade drugs under investigation that will redefine
              the standard of care for bladder cancer. CTLA-4 inhibitors are
              also under investigation in this setting. Atezolizumab, approved
              in May 2016, and nivolumab, approved in February 2017, are the
              first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
              immune-checkpoint inhibitors in bladder cancer for
              platinum-pretreated patients based on phase II data. On March 16,
              2017, results from the phase III trial KEYNOTE-045 demonstrated

              non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer at high risk of recurrence or
              progression. Preclinical and clinical studies have revealed that
              a robust inflammatory response to BCG involves several steps:
              attachment of BCG; internalization of BCG into resident immune
              cells, normal cells, and tumour urothelial cells; BCG-mediated
              induction of innate immunity, which is orchestrated by a cellular
              and cytokine milieu; and BCG-mediated initiation of
              tumour-specific immunity. As an added layer of complexity,
              variation between clinical BCG strains might influence
              development of tumour immunity. However, more than 40 years after
              the first use of BCG for bladder cancer, many questions regarding
              its mechanism of action remain unanswered. Clearly, a better
              understanding of the mechanisms underlying BCG-mediated tumour
              immunity could lead to improved efficacy, increased tolerance of
              treatment, and identification of novel immune-based therapies.
              Indeed, enthusiasm for bladder cancer immunotherapy, and the
              possibility of combining BCG with other therapies, is increasing
              owing to the availability of targeted immunotherapies, including
              checkpoint inhibitors. Understanding of the mechanism of action

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In the last decade, Next-Generation Sequencing
              technologies have been extensively applied to quantitative
              transcriptomics, making RNA sequencing a valuable alternative to
              microarrays for measuring and comparing gene transcription
              levels. Although several methods have been proposed to provide an
              unbiased estimate of transcript abundances through data
              normalization, all of them are based on an initial count of the
              total number of reads mapping on each transcript. This procedure,
              in principle robust to random noise, is actually error-prone if
              reads are not uniformly distributed along sequences, as happens
              indeed due to sequencing errors and ambiguity in read mapping.
              Here we propose a new approach, called maxcounts, to quantify the
              expression assigned to an exon as the maximum of its per-base
              counts, and we assess its performance in comparison with the
              standard approach described above, which considers the total
              number of reads aligned to an exon. The two measures are compared
              using multiple data sets and considering several evaluation
              criteria: independence from gene-specific covariates, such as
              exon length and GC-content, accuracy and precision in the
              quantification of true concentrations and robustness of
              measurements to variations of alignments quality. RESULTS: Both
              measures show high accuracy and low dependency on GC-content.
              However, maxcounts expression quantification is less biased
              towards long exons with respect to the standard approach.
              Moreover, it shows lower technical variability at low expressions
              and is more robust to variations in the quality of alignments.
              CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we confirm that counts computed with the
              standard approach depend on the length of the feature they are
              summarized on, and are sensitive to the non-uniform distribution
              of reads along transcripts. On the opposite, maxcounts are robust
              to biases due to the non-uniformity distribution of reads and are
              characterized by a lower technical variability. Hence, we propose
              maxcounts as an alternative approach for quantitative
              RNA-sequencing applications.",

              trap is produced transiently and locally in the tumor

              Significantly, unlike the combination of OxP and anti-PD-L1 mAb,
              the combination of OxP and PD-L1 trap does not induce obvious

              malignancy characterized by unregulated growth of plasma cells in
              the bone marrow. The treatment paradigm for myeloma underwent
              significant evolution in the last decade, with an improved
              understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease as well as the
              development of therapeutic agents that target not only the tumor
              cells but also their microenvironment. Despite these therapeutic
              advances, the prognosis of patients with relapsed or refractory
              myeloma remains poor. Accordingly, a need exists for new
              therapeutic avenues that can overcome resistance to current
              therapies and improve survival outcomes. In addition, myeloma is
              associated with progressive immune dysregulation, with defects in
              T-cell immunity, natural killer cell function, and the
              antigen-presenting capacity of dendritic cells, resulting in a
              tumor microenvironment that promotes disease tolerance and
              progression. Together, the immunosuppressive microenvironment and
              oncogenic mutations activate signaling networks that promote
              myeloma cell survival. Immunotherapy incorporates novel treatment
              options (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates,
              chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, immune checkpoint
              inhibitors, bispecific antibodies, and tumor vaccines) either

              survival rate is < 50\%. Moreover, patients with
              platinum-refractory HNSCC have a median survival of < 6 months.
              The significant toxicity and low survival rates of current
              treatment strategies highlight the necessity for new treatment
              modalities. Recently, a large number of studies have demonstrated
              that programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand,
              programmed cell death protein ligand-1 (PD-L1) play an essential
              role in tumor initiation and progression. PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has
              shown a desired and long-lasting therapeutic effect in the
              treatment of HNSCC and other malignancies. However, only a small
              number of patients with HNSCC can benefit from PD-1/PD-L1

              eventually develop resistance to these targeted therapies.
              Recently, immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors
              have revolutionized the treatment paradigm for many types of
              malignancies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for
              treatment of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell
              carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Hodgkin's
              lymphoma, bladder cancer and gastric cancer. However, oncologists
              have been faced with immune-related adverse events caused by
              immune checkpoint inhibitors; these are generally mild but can be
              fatal in some cases. Because immune checkpoint inhibitors have
              distinct toxicity profiles from those of chemotherapy or targeted
              therapy, many oncologists are not familiar with the principles
              for optimal management of immune-related adverse events, which
              require early recognition and appropriate treatment without
              delay. To achieve this, oncologists must educate patients and
              health-care workers, develop checklists of appropriate tests for
              immune-related adverse events and collaborate closely with organ
              specialists. Clinical questions that remain include whether
              immune checkpoint inhibitors should be administered to patients
              with autoimmune disease and whether patients for whom
              immune-related adverse events lead to delays in immunotherapy

              immune-related adverse events. This review provides an overview

              Next-generation sequencing of cancer genomes and epigenomes has
              defined large numbers of driver mutations and molecular
              subgroups, leading to therapeutic advances. By comparison, there
              is a relative paucity of such knowledge in premalignant
              neoplasia, which inherently limits the potential to develop
              precision prevention strategies. Studies on the interplay between
              germ-line and somatic events have elucidated genetic processes
              underlying premalignant progression and preventive targets.
              Emerging data hint at the immune system's ability to intercept
              premalignancy and prevent cancer. Genetically engineered mouse
              models have identified mechanisms by which genetic drivers and
              other somatic alterations recruit inflammatory cells and induce
              changes in normal cells to create and interact with the
              premalignant tumor microenvironment to promote oncogenesis and
              immune evasion. These studies are currently limited to only a few
              lesion types and patients. In this Perspective, we advocate a
              large-scale collaborative effort to systematically map the
              biology of premalignancy and the surrounding cellular response.
              By bringing together scientists from diverse disciplines (e.g.,
              biochemistry, omics, and computational biology; microbiology,
              immunology, and medical genetics; engineering, imaging, and
              synthetic chemistry; and implementation science), we can drive a
              concerted effort focused on cancer vaccines to reprogram the
              immune response to prevent, detect, and reject premalignancy.
              Lynch syndrome, clonal hematopoiesis, and cervical
              intraepithelial neoplasia which also serve as models for
              inherited syndromes, blood, and viral premalignancies, are ideal
              scenarios in which to launch this initiative.",

              involved in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway as well as for
              matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 (MMP2 and MMP9) were measured
              by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
              Western blot methods, respectively. RESULTS: Blockading PD-L1
              significantly inhibited tumor growth and decreased the levels of
              PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue. Furthermore, the levels of PTEN
              mRNA and protein expression were elevated, while the levels of
              phospho-Akt (p-Akt) and phospho-mTOR (p-mTOR) protein were
              decreased in pancreatic cancer and liver metastasis tissues after
              establishing a PD-L1 blockade. In addition, a PD-L1 blockade
              decreased the levels of MMP2 and MMP9 mRNA and protein expression
              in tumor tissues. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a blockade
              of PD-L1 may inhibit the growth and metastasis of pancreatic
              cancer by modulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.",

              suppressive activities, which involves transcriptional activation
              of target genes responsible for apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest.
              Mutational occurrences within or in close proximity to the
              DNA-binding surface of p53 have accounted for the loss of direct
              DNA-binding ability and inactivation implicated in many cases of
              cancer. Moreover, the design of therapeutic compounds that can
              restore DNA-binding ability in p53 mutants has been identified as
              a way forward in curtailing their oncogenic activities. However,
              there is still the need for more insights into evaluate the
              perturbations that occur at the DNA-binding interface of mp53
              relative to DNA-binding loss, inactivation, and design of potent
              reactivators, hence the purpose of this study. Therefore, we
              evaluated p53-structural (R175H) and contact (R273C) mutational
              effects using tunnel perturbation analysis and other
              computational tools. We identified significant perturbations in
              the active tunnels of p53, which resulted in altered geometry and
              loss, unlike in the wild-type p53. This corroborated with
              structural, DNA-binding, and interaction network analysis, which
              showed that loss of flexibility, repulsion of DNA-interactive
              residues, and instability occurred at the binding interface of
              both mutants. Also, these mutations altered bonding interactions
              and network topology at the DNA-binding interface, resulting in
              the reduction of p53-DNA binding proximity and affinity.
              Therefore, these findings would aid the structure-based design of

              cells in different diseases such as cancer. Large-scale protein
              signaling networks contain an important number of experimentally

              outcomes of the system, and therefore to be trained with respect
              to experimental measurements. Boolean Networks (BNs) are a simple
              yet powerful framework to study and model the dynamics of the
              protein signaling networks. While many BN approaches exist to
              model biological systems, they focus mainly on system properties,
              and few exist to integrate experimental data in them. In this
              work, we show an application of a method conceived to integrate
              time series phosphoproteomic data into protein signaling
              networks. We use a large-scale real case study from the HPN-DREAM
              Breast Cancer challenge. Our efficient and parameter-free method
              combines logic programming and model-checking to infer a family
              of BNs from multiple perturbation time series data of four breast
              cancer cell lines given a prior protein signaling network.
              Because each predicted BN family is cell line specific, our
              method highlights commonalities and discrepancies between the
              four cell lines. Our models have a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
              of 0.31 with respect to the testing data, while the best
              performant method of this HPN-DREAM challenge had a RMSE of 0.47.
              To further validate our results, BNs are compared with the
              canonical mTOR pathway showing a comparable AUROC score (0.77) to
              the top performing HPN-DREAM teams. In addition, our approach can
              also be used as a complementary method to identify erroneous

              TMEM41B is a multispanning membrane protein localized in the

              bacterial DedA family of putative half-transporters. Deletion of
              TMEM41B blocked the formation of autophagosomes at an early step,

              differences between cell types or between healthy and diseased

              regulatory networks. Understanding these molecular and cellular

              stratification and facilitate the design of rational intervention

              make weak assumptions about the distribution of model parameters

              pathways that are associated with TP53 expression status in
              HBV-related HCC. The strongest mechanism involved the modulation
              of major histocompatibility complex, class II, DP beta 1 (human
              leukocyte antigen [HLA]-DPB1-rs1042153), major histocompatibility

              cancer. Mutations of the TP53 gene, particularly in the DNA
              binding domain, have been regarded as the main cause for p53
              inactivation. However, recent reports demonstrating abundance of
              p53 isoforms, especially the N-terminally truncated ones, in the
              cancerous tissues suggest their involvement in carcinogenesis.
              These isoforms are ∆40p53, ∆133p53, and ∆160p53 (the names
              indicate their respective N-terminal truncation). Due to the lack
              of structural and functional characterizations the modes of
              action of the p53 isoforms are still unclear. Owing to the
              deletions in the functional domains, these isoforms can either be
              defective in DNA binding or more susceptive to altered
              'responsive elements' than p53. Furthermore, they may exert a
              'dominant negative effect' or induce more aggressive cancer by
              the 'gain of function'. One possible mechanism of p53
              inactivation can be through tetramerization with the ∆133p53 and
              ∆160p53 isoforms-both lacking part of the DNA binding domain. A
              recent report and unpublished data from our laboratory also

              Accumulating evidence has shown that the tumor microenvironment,

              for cancer proliferation, metastasis, and maintenance of cancer

              the development and progression of cancer. In contrast, metabolic
              regulation, such as aberrant metabolism in cancer, is poorly
              understood. Alteration in cellular metabolism was once regarded
              simply as a consequence of cancer rather than as playing a
              primary role in cancer promotion and maintenance. Resurgence of
              cancer metabolism research has identified critical metabolic
              reprogramming events within biosynthetic and bioenergetic
              pathways needed to fulfill the requirements of cancer cell growth
              and maintenance. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is emerging as
              a key regulator of metabolic processes and metabolic
              reprogramming in cancer cells---balancing the pendulum between
              cell death and survival. This review provides an overview of the
              classical and emerging non-classical tumor suppressor roles of
              p53 in regulating mitochondrial dynamics: mitochondrial
              engagement in cell death processes in the prevention of cancer.
              On the other hand, we discuss p53 as a key metabolic switch in
              cellular function and survival. The focus is then on the
              conceivable roles of p53 in breast cancer metabolism.
              Understanding the metabolic functions of p53 within breast cancer
              metabolism will, in due course, reveal critical metabolic
              hotspots that cancers advantageously re-engineer for sustenance.
              Illustration of these events will pave the way for finding novel
              therapeutics that target cancer metabolism and serve to overcome
              the breast cancer burden.",

              prediction model based on large-scale pharmacogenomic of cancer

              integrates protein--protein interactions and captures similarity
              of cell lines' functional contexts, to predict drug responses.
              Through integrating genomic aberrations and drug responses

              functions, referred to as gain of function, that may actively

              the best-characterized oncogenic activities of mutant p53 are
              mediated by its ability to form aberrant protein complexes with
              other transcription factors or proteins not directly related to

  abstract = "Chemotherapeutic drugs have a common intent to activate apoptosis
              in tumor cells. However, master regulators of apoptosis (e.g.,
              p53, p16/CDKN2A) are frequently genetically inactivated in
              cancers, resulting in multidrug resistance. An alternative,
              p53-independent method for terminating malignant proliferation is
              to engage terminal-differentiation. Normally, the exponential
              proliferation of lineage-committed progenitors, coordinated by
              the master transcription factor (TF) MYC, is self-limited by
              forward-differentiation to terminal lineage-fates. In cancers,
              however, this exponential proliferation is disengaged from
              terminal-differentiation. The mechanisms underlying this
              decoupling are mostly unknown. We performed a systematic review
              of published literature (January 2007-June 2018) to identify gene
              pathways linked to differentiation-failure in three
              treatment-recalcitrant cancers: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
              ovarian cancer (OVC), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
              (PDAC). We analyzed key gene alterations in various apoptosis,
              proliferation and differentiation pathways to determine whether
              it is possible to predict treatment outcomes and suggest novel
              therapies. Poorly differentiated tumors were linked to poorer
              survival across histologies. Our analyses suggested
              loss-of-function events to master TF drivers of lineage-fates and
              their cofactors as being linked to differentiation-failure:
              genomic data in TCGA and ICGC databases demonstrated frequent
              haploinsufficiency of lineage master TFs (e.g., GATA4/6) in
              poorly differentiated tumors; the coactivators that these TFs use
              to activate genes (e.g. ARID1A, PBRM1) were also frequently
              inactivated by genetic mutation and/or deletion. By contrast,
              corepressor components (e.g., DNMT1, EED, UHRF1, and BAZ1A/B),
              that oppose coactivators to repress or turn off genes, were
              frequently amplified instead, and the level of amplification was
              highest in poorly differentiated lesions. This selection by
              neoplastic evolution towards unbalanced activity of
              transcriptional corepressors suggests these enzymes as candidate
              targets for inhibition aiming to re-engage

              those of its tissue of origin has not been conducted. The RNA-Seq
              data generated by the GTEx project is the first available data
              resource in which it is possible to perform a large-scale
              transcriptional and regulatory network analysis comparing cell
              lines with their tissues of origin. RESULTS: We compared 127
              paired Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines
              (LCLs) and whole blood samples, and 244 paired primary fibroblast
              cell lines and skin samples. While gene expression analysis
              confirms that these cell lines carry the expression signatures of
              their primary tissues, albeit at reduced levels, network analysis
              indicates that expression changes are the cumulative result of
              many previously unreported alterations in transcription factor
              (TF) regulation. More specifically, cell cycle genes are
              over-expressed in cell lines compared to primary tissues, and
              this alteration in expression is a result of less repressive TF
              targeting. We confirmed these regulatory changes for four TFs,
              including SMAD5, using independent ChIP-seq data from ENCODE.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide novel insights into the
              regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression differences
              between cell lines and tissues. The strong changes in TF
              regulation that we observe suggest that network changes, in
              addition to transcriptional levels, should be considered when
              using cell lines as models for tissues.",

              protein-coding genes and encoded in viral vectors have been used
              to systematically create gene knockouts in a variety of human

              damage response. The activation of apoptosis by p53 involves the
              intrinsic apoptotic pathway to eliminate stressed cells that
              contain DNA lesions. Recent experiments have found that apoptosis
              happen in an all-or-none switch like manner (Albeck et al., 2008;
              Rehm et al., 2002). We focus on modelling the mechanism of p53
              activation of apoptosis in response to sustained high DNA
              double-strand breaks. The aim of the research is to investigate
              the design principles behind the regulation of p53 activation of
              apoptotic switch. Building on previous models (Chong et al.,
              2015; Zhang et al., 2009a), we developed a mathematical model
              that incorporated the molecular interactions in the core
              regulation of p53 and the apoptosis initiation module involving
              Puma, Bcl2 and Bax. Activation of Bax was assumed to be an
              indicator of apoptosis initiation. Chen et al. (2013) suggested
              that one of the components in the p53 pathway may control a
              threshold activation of apoptosis. We hypothesized that ATM
              auto-activation is the component that controls p53 threshold
              activation of apoptosis with ATM's multi-site autophosphorylation
              depending on damage intensity. The constructed model demonstrated
              how molecular interactions and stress signalling molecule ATM's
              auto-activation of the p53 network dictate cell fate decisions.
              Our simulation results are qualitatively consistent with the

              malfunction of the apoptotic switch. We present a simplified yet

              potential immunogenic somatic mutations on the basis of their
              co-occurrence with CDR3 sequences. One of them, a PRAMEF4
              mutation encoding p.Phe300Val, was predicted to result in peptide
              binding strongly to both MHC class I and class II molecules, with
              matched HLA types in its carriers. Our analyses have the
              potential to simultaneously identify immunogenic neoantigens and
              tumor-reactive T cell clonotypes.",
